Update: [Back in the S&P 500]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-08-21-Back-in-the-SP500 %})

In February, I dropped some Berkshire Hathaway and bought
some Amazon. When the market crashed in March due to the initial
COVID-19 panic, I moved most of my money into cash. Then as I gained
confidence, I bought more. Amazon is where most of my cash is invested.

If you read my 2014 article
[Lazy Investing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-11-27-Lazy-Investing %}),
you might say I am
contradicting myself. Actually, that article was an example of
confirmation bias. (I have that tendency, and perhaps this article
should poke more holes in my conclusion.) It took me five years to
realize that the article was about convincing myself about my
existing conviction.

I have to thank many lunch time conversations with Janis
and [Evan](https://evan.carlin.com) for challenging my convictions. I
also have to thank Warren Buffett for saying "You have to learn how to
value businesses and know the ones that are within your circle of
competence and the ones that are outside."

In this article, I document my investing strategy promoted by my
rethinking in February. I discuss my asset allocation, but the primary
focus is an attempt to value Amazon, because I believe it is within my
circle of competence to do so. I want to know if my big bet on Amazon
makes sense.

## Bucking Tradition

Some investment advisors would have me put
60% of my money in bonds
and the rest in stock. Others say 110 or 120 minus your age in stocks, or
50-60%, in my case. I think formulas like this are ridiculous, and not
based on actual circumstances.

I own real estate. How much is it worth? Real estate is a
leveraged investment. What should my leverage be at my age? How much
should I keep in real estate vs cash vs bonds vs stock? I also own a
significant chunk of two private companies. These are highly illiquid
assets. Should I divest? If so, when?

Some people would say I should be paying off your mortgage before I
retire. Others would say that my privately held stock is stock, and I
need to adjust my publicly held stock accordingly. None of this is
incorporated in the age-based calculations of stocks vs bonds.

My portfolio is a victim of circumstance. I lived in a house, and I
didn't sell it when I moved out. Janis is a real estate agent, and she
thinks real estate is a good investment. One day she told me to buy
another house so I did. Unlike stocks, you can't just drop a house for
another one so I keep the houses for many reasons: inertia, the solid
real estate market, and personal circumstances. Owning real estate
diversifies my asset allocation.

My 401K only allows me to invest in mutual funds. During the COVID
panic, I moved it all into a long term bond fund (VBLTX), because I
figured it was slightly better than the money market. The fact that I
can't put it in Amazon is a good thing, but why not put it in the S&P?

"Consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund," Warren Buffett
[told CNBC's On The Money](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/03/why-warren-buffett-says-index-funds-are-the-best-investment.html).
"I think it's the thing that makes the most sense practically all of
the time."

If you have a long horizon, this makes perfect sense. Perhaps if I
hadn't put all my savings into myriad startups, I'd have more savings
now, and a bet on the S&P would have paid off. However, I have less
savings than I need to retire, and I am confident that 1) I can work
till I'm 75 and/or 2) I can take on much more risk so I might
not have to.

COVID has created uncertainty like I have never seen before. The stock
market is driven by fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) investors and/or
speculators. I decided in March to sit out of the S&P for a while. If
I lose a year's gains, so be it. I can have a multi-decade horizon on
my 401K funds, since I'm being more agressive with my other accounts.

So my asset mix is pretty random. I do not think there's a formula
that could help me with my unique situation. I also know that I need
to be aggressive with a large part of my portfolio so that I can
retire comfortably.

## How to Get Rich

I wrote
[Objectively Rich]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2009-06-13-Objectively-Rich %})
in 2009. It talks about how to get the best money manager by looking
at the richest people in the world. Buffett was/is near
the top, so I concluded I should invest in Berkshire Hathaway,
alongside him. Not unsound, but I missed something.

When I was thinking about a money manager,
I was thinking about investing in a diversified portfolio. I already
have asset diversification (noted above). The question is: do I need
diversification in an asset class? Or, is it better to make big bets
on individual companies, like Amazon? The question isn't: which money
manager should I hire, but with whom can I invest. That opens up
more possibilities.

Even in 2009, I recognized that the richest people in the world built
single company. Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway. Gates create
Microsoft. The richest list is even more heavily populated by tech and
retail/consumer companies. I certainly tried my hand at getting rich
like these people on my own companies, but I'm not like these
people. They are clearly different from me.

## Jeff Bezos

Jeff Bezos is currently the richest person in the world. He graduated
with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering from
Princeton in 1986. Excellent credentials to do any job, and he did
have a few jobs before starting Amazon. He has been focused on Amazon
since 1993. I appreciate his single-minded focus, and it obviously
has worked out well for Amazon.

Bezos is
[ruthless](https://www.grunge.com/143621/the-dark-truth-about-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos/).
I have heard that from people who have worked for him. To make Amazon
big, you have to be ruthless. I'm not ruthless. I don't generally like
ruthless people. Steve Jobs was ruthless. Bill Gates was, too.

Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc. are as big as they are, because of
these ruthless leaders. That's harsh, but competing in business is
tough, especially retail. Sam Walton was no doubt ruthless, too, and
according to
[this article](https://www.history.com/news/how-one-ruthless-impresario-blazed-a-trail-for-wal-mart-and-amazon)
so was Frank Winfield Woolworth before him.

Lots of people love working for these behemoths, despite their
ruthless leaders, or maybe because of them.  I'm not one of them of
these people, but I can certainly invest in these companies, because I
think their leaders do what they have to for their stakeholders, which
do include their customers and workers. Despite what many think, these
companies would not have grown so quickly if they treated their
customers or workers badly.

## Amazon

Amazon used technology to sell retail, better. That's one of my reasons
Amazon is the best bet among the tech giants. Retail is a huge
industry: worldwide retail sales are $24 trillion per year. People
need to eat and to clothe themselves. World income is rising, and
along with it, consumerism. (I'm not saying this is a good thing, but
it is a hard fact.)

Retail is a fickle business. I would not want to run a retail
business. You have to move with the trends. Amazon moves with the
trends. We are in the middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Amazon
stopped all deliveries of non-essential goods to its warehouses.
That's because at Amazon, [it is always Day 1](http://n99.us/ukg).

That's another reason why I don't mind so much about how ruthless
Bezos is: he has done great things for our society by focusing on
Day 1:

* Created a logistics business that employs many hundreds of thousands.
* Despite the criticism of Mechanical Turk, I believe
  it gives people work anywhere in the world, out of their
  own homes, and on their own schedule.
* Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing platform virtually created
  the [self-publishing market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-publishing).
* Prime made shopping online competitive with Walmart and Costco.
* Echo was the first home digital assistant, which
  now enables thousands of small businesses to reach homes. For example,
  my nephew's company, [MapHabit](https://www.maphabit.com), which is
  enhancing the quality of life of Alzheimer's patients and their
  families through cognitive tools delivered via Alexa.
* Marketplace allows over a million sellers to fulfill
  product deliveries without ever touching the product
  itself. Marketplace revenue
  [just crossed 50% of Amazon's total revenue](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazons-retail-business-is-now-just-50-of-the-companys-revenue),
  that is, third party selling is a $140B business and growing.

## Growth

Walmart has been trying to compete with Amazon for a decade or more. I
have bought stuff from Walmart both on and offline. Walmart's revenues
($514B) are still bigger than Amazon ($280B). The difference is that
Walmart's growth has been under 10% for the last decade, and Amazon's
has been over 20%.

There are other big companies, e.g. Apple, which are growing almost as
fast, but Amazon is growing faster. It surpassed Apple's revenues this
year, and it is on track to surpassing Walmart in a couple of years.

Amazon's growth is diversified. It isn't just selling retail. AWS is
growing by over 30%, and it, too, is becoming more diversified. The
range of options on AWS is so mind boggling that a whole industry as
formed to help you manage AWS.

Retail is a huge industry, which means there's lots of room for
growth. Amazon has changed the industry forever, to both the
industry's and Amazon's benefit. I can see at least another decade of
double digit growth.

## Eat Your Own Dog Food

Technology is key to Amazon's success. Companies like Google and
Facebook, also became successful through technology. However,
technology at Amazon grew up around a problem: selling things. Then,
it grew into a thing on its own: Amazon Web Services. Neither Facebook
nor Google
[eats their own dog food](http://n99.us/exx)
like Amazon does. It's funny, when I searched for this Wikipedia
page I typed "Eat your own dog food" and the first completion on
Google was "Eat your own dog food Amazon".

Dogfooding is important. If AWS is down, services at amazon.com might
be broken. I have used a number of cloud providers, and none of the
big ones work as well as AWS. (I do like and use Linode.com, but they
are a niche provider.)

Microsoft were the
[original dogfooders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#Origin_of_the_term).
This made Windows more reliable. I wonder if they are dogfooding their
cloud products. From my own experience with Azure (Microsoft's AWS
competitor), I would say not likely, even though Microsoft is Number
Two in cloud computing. Azure is clunky to use, and I only know a few
people who use it.

## Cloud Computing Revenues

Investors pay a lot of attention to The Cloud. I'm less interested,
because it is a small part of Amazon's revenue. AWS revenue was $35B
in 2019 -- if we take it as face value, more about this later. AWS grew
from $25B in 2018, and is on track to increase by that much again
in 2020. Amazon's total revenue in 2018 was $233B, and rose to $281B
in 2019. That's 20% growth in a much larger market ($24T). Yet, I know
that investors pay attention so should I.

One question I had is whether AWS recognizes revenue from, say, Prime
Video. A recent 10-K states "Costs to operate our AWS segment are
primarily classified as 'Technology and content' as we leverage a
shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology
requirements and external sales to AWS customers." I take from this
statement that they treat "internal technology" as a cost. I don't
think it would be legal for them to recognize revenue from internal
"sales", and enough people are watching that I feel safe in that
assumption.

Investors are very excited about Microsoft, which has a higher market
capitalization than Amazon, despite having only $126B in revenue in 2019 and
$110B in 2018. Growth at Microsoft has been less than 15%. It's
strange to me that their market cap is so high. The big excitement
in the news is Azure growth, but there's a
problem: Microsoft is
[hiding Azure revenue numbers](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-keeps-hiding-azure-revenue-numbers-but-why/).

Azure revenues are important, because I would like to know if AWS is
far and away the biggest cloud service, or if competitors are eating
into AWS's revenue. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment includes
Azure, GitHub, Windows Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio, and
Enterprise Services (Consulting and Support). Intelligent Cloud
revenues were $39B in 2019. However, no one seems what Azure's
standalone revenues are.

I tried to do my own analysis, and gave up. Microsoft keeps on
recategorizing "commercial cloud" to mean something else, and it seems
to be getting bigger. (Go to the 2017 and 2019 annual reports and
search on "Revenue from external customers" to see what I mean.)

However, I am pretty sure that Azure revenues are a small percentage
of the $39B stated in 2019 for the same reason that Amazon didn't post
seperate numbers for AWS during its first nine years. Small numbers
are not interesting to investors. If Azure growth is 72%, it's not on
$10B, because the delta between 2018 and 2019 Server Products and
Cloud Services is $6B.

My conclusion is that Microsoft is not eating AWS's lunch, at least
not yet.

## Problems

AWS has had its share of outages, some huge, while others lost
customer data. They could be hit again. I'm very critical of cloud
infrastructure, specifically the
[Big Red Button]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2014-06-24-Nuclear-Deterrence-For-Your-Cloud %}).
Yet, the cloud is here to stay, and despite all these problems, AWS is
still considered a leader.

Counterfeit merchandise is a huge problem for Amazon. They luanched
the [Counterfit Crimes Unit](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/amazon-establishes-new-counterfeit-crime-unit?ots=1&tag=curbedcom06-20&linkCode=w50)
recently, which hopefully will help with this. Nike stopped selling
directly on Amazon, and other big brands sometimes shun Amazon.

Failed products are not uncommon: Fire Phone, Local, and Register were
the biggest. It seems that Amazon kills products pretty
quickly, and doesn't seem to infuriate customers like Google
does.

The recent
[antitrust hearings in Congress](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/29/21346584/jeff-bezos-amazon-antitrust-hearing-congressional-testimony-power-to-make-or-break-small-merchants)
did not go well for Amazon. It is difficult to see how Amazon would be
seen as a monopoly, but regulators could force Amazon to make
changes. Amazon tends to beat regulators to the, e.g. by setting a
minimum wage of $15 that is double the Federal minimum wage. They were
very aggressive in their handling of COVID. I don't discount the
regulatory risk, but I also don't think it's the biggest risk.

## Truck Problem

Jeff Bezos, I believe, is the achilles heal of Amazon.  If he were to
die unexpectedly, the stock would take a big hit, and maybe the
company would never recover. Can Andy Jassy or Jeff Wilke [fill Bezos's
shoes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2020/06/26/amazons-looming-problem-who-has-the-strategic-mindset-to-replace-jeff-bezos/#1e4fdea61537)?

There is no way to mitigate this risk. You either live with it or
not. My guess is that the stock could drop as much as 50% if Bezos
were to die suddenly. That's a big risk, but it's the problem with
betting on one company, even one as large as Amazon.

Investors seem to be more and more decoupled from the fundamentals of
companies. Losing a CEO is important, but to run a large company, you
need lots of company people. That doesn't mean anything if the
"market" reacts to news, which it does.

My plan would be to ride it out. I believe in Amazon as a business for
all the reasons above and more.

## My Circle of Competence

Unlike Warren Buffett, I am a technologist. I understand why Amazon
made the decisions they made in their technology. I have friends who
have worked at Amazon. I have started many different companies, and
I get what it takes to be a success. Dogfooding and Day 1 are key
concepts that I try to employ.

I interact with Amazon on a daily basis. I read on my Kindle every
day. I often watch Amazon Video. I buy things for my home and
businesses on Amazon. I use Amazon Web Services. I listen to
Music, which I start by talking to Alexa via my Echo. I listen to
audio books on Audible. Buffett knows Dairy Queen and Coca-Cola, I know
Amazon. I've been a customer since 1998 when I moved back to the US,
and I spend thousands per year at Amazon businesses.

But it's not just me: Amazon trucks pass by my quiet street multiple
times a day. Amazon is an integral part of my society. And, more
importantly, we share [the same progressive values](http://n99.us/mjx)
while still believing in capitalism.

## What About Diversification?

In 2008, Warren Buffett made a ten year bet that the S&P 500 would beat
a hedge fund and
[the hedge fund manager conceded two years early](http://n99.us/noo). Buffett
says that non-professional investors should invest in low-cost index
funds. This is solid wisdom, and John C. Boggle made a fortune
creating that industry.

But right now, five companies make up more than 20% of the market
capitalization of the S&P 500. This is a problem for
diversification. The five are: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google,
Microsoft. So even if you invest in VOO or SPY, you are into tech, big
time.

Thinking about it differently, if you are 100% invested in the VOO,
you are 5% invested in Microsoft, 5% invested in Apple, etc. Those are
big investment decisions to make. If you are looking for
diversification, 5% is a big number. Moreover, Berkshire (number 6)
holds about 5% of Apple, which makes up 40% of its holdings right now
and growing.

I use Apple products, but I am not a fan of Apple as an
investment. They do sell retail, but they are focused on a narrow
range of products. It is hard for them to be agile. That's why I am
not betting on Apple.

Diversification is thought to be safe, but it leads to owning a lot of
Day 2 companies. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, and I would
not buy a single share of most of them. Why would I think "in
aggregate" that the S&P 500 is a good bet? I don't, any more.

## Confirmation Bias

In the end, I'm making a bet. That's why this article isn't called
"Investing in Amazon". This is a big bet that involves significant
risks. It's not for everyone.

I have tried to clarify my thinking about the bet in this article. I
have to thank [Evan](https://evan.carlin.com) for his clear-sighted
review of the first version of this article. I revisted my thinking
and made it much more personal.

I wonder what I'll be saying about this article in 10 years.
