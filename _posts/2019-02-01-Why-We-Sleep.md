By Matthew Walker, Scribner, October 3, 2017, 978-1501144325

It's thorough and well-written. Walker explains the process of sleep
in great detail. Then he tells us how we need to change society,
particularly school hours. It's a little bit over the top in the
second to last chapter where sleep is the cause of everything.

He presents lots of confirming studies. I am a little skeptical that
he doesn't present some alternative studies that disagree with his
bias towards sleep. I found an insignificant factual error (repeating
urban legend about coffee trade -- see below), which was easily
invalidated, but it demonstrates his over the top belief in the
studies he presents.

If you don't know much about sleep, this is a very readable book.

> [k413] One consequence of increasing adenosine in the brain is an

NOTE: [Not true](http://n99.us/yqf): In 2017, oil was $788B, aluminum
was $106B, copper was $104B, iron ore was $67B, and coffee was $19B.

> [k423] Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively inactivates the

> [k429] Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours.

> [k713] Since your brain desires most of its REM sleep in the last
> part of the night, which is to say the late-morning hours, you will
> lose 60 to 90 percent of all your REM sleep, even though you are
> losing 25 percent of your total sleep time.

> [k825] When it comes to information processing, think of the wake
> state principally as reception (experiencing and constantly learning
> the world around you), NREM sleep as reflection (storing and
> strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and
> REM sleep as integration (interconnecting these raw ingredients with
> each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an
> ever more accurate model of how the world works, including
> innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).

> [k1034] But if you bring that person into a sleep laboratory, or
> take them to a hotel--both of which are unfamiliar sleep
> environments--one half of the brain sleeps a little lighter than the
> other, as if it's standing guard with just a tad more vigilance due
> to the potentially less safe context that the conscious brain has
> registered while awake. The more nights an individual sleeps in the
> new location, the more similar the sleep is in each half of the
> brain.

> [k1081] On average, these tribespeople will fall asleep two to three
> hours after sunset, around nine p.m. Their nighttime sleep bouts
> will come to an end just prior to, or soon after, dawn.

NOTE: Do they have night owls and early birds?

> [k1090] The practice of biphasic sleep is not cultural in origin,
> however. It is deeply biological. All humans, irrespective of
> culture or geographical location, have a genetically hardwired dip
> in alertness that occurs in the midafternoon hours.

> [k1127] These napping communities have sometimes been described as
> "the places where people forget to die." From a prescription written
> long ago in our ancestral genetic code, the practice of natural
> biphasic sleep, and a healthy diet, appear to be the keys to a
> long-sustained life. WE ARE SPECIAL Sleep, as you can now
> appreciate, is a unifying feature across the animal kingdom, yet
> within and between species there is remarkable diversity in amount
> (e.g., time), form (e.g., half-brain, whole-brain), and pattern
> (monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic).

> [k1171] From these clues, I offer a theorem: the tree-to-ground
> reengineering of sleep was a key trigger that rocketed Homo sapiens
> to the top of evolution's lofty pyramid. At least two features
> define human beings relative to other primates. I posit that both
> have been beneficially and causally shaped by the hand of sleep, and
> specifically our intense degree of REM sleep relative to all other
> mammals: (1) our degree of sociocultural complexity, and (2) our
> cognitive intelligence. REM sleep, and the act of dreaming itself,
> lubricates both of these human traits.

> [k1292] Most notable, however, is the significant shortage of REM
> sleep. Autistic individuals show a 30 to 50 percent deficit in the
> amount of REM sleep they obtain, relative to children without
> autism.

> [k1304] Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep
> that we know of.

> [k1417] As deep NREM sleep performs its final overhaul and
> refinement of the brain during adolescence, cognitive skills,
> reasoning, and critical thinking start to improve, and do so in a
> proportional manner with that NREM sleep change. Taking a closer
> look at the timing of this relationship, you see something even more
> interesting. The changes in deep NREM sleep always precede the
> cognitive and developmental milestones within the brain by several
> weeks or months, implying a direction of influence: deep sleep may
> be a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way
> around. Feinberg made a second seminal discovery. When he examined
> the timeline of changing deep-sleep intensity at each different
> electrode spot on the head, it was not the same. Instead, the
> rise-and-fall pattern of maturation always began at the back of the
> brain, which performs the functions of visual and spatial
> perception, and then progressed steadily forward as adolescence
> progressed.

> [k1427] His findings helped explain why rationality is one of the
> last things to flourish in teenagers, as it is the last brain
> territory to receive sleep's maturational treatment.

> [k1452] Faulty pruning of brain connections in schizophrenia caused
> by sleep abnormalities is now one of the most active and exciting
> areas of investigation in psychiatric illness.

> [k1679] Sleep before learning refreshes our ability to initially
> make new memories .

> [k1698] In contrast, those who napped did markedly better, and
> actually improved in their capacity to memorize facts. The
> difference between the two groups at six p.m. was not small: a 20
> percent learning advantage for those who slept.

> [k2161] The recycle rate of a human being is around sixteen
> hours. After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to
> fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to
> maintain cognitive performance.

> [k2168] As a result, 1.2 million accidents are caused by sleepiness
> each year in the United States.

> [k2176] As a result, car crashes caused by drowsiness tend to be far
> more deadly than those caused by alcohol or drugs.

> [k2181] And when a truck driver loses his or her life in a
> drowsy-driving crash, they will, on average, take 4.5 other lives
> with them.

> [k2509] Should you experimentally prevent a mouse from getting NREM
> sleep, keeping it awake instead, there is an immediate increase in
> amyloid deposits within the brain. Without sleep, an escalation of
> poisonous Alzheimer's-related protein accumulated in the brains of
> the mice, together with several other toxic metabolites.

> [k2516] From this cascade comes a prediction: getting too little
> sleep across the adult life span will significantly raise your risk
> of developing Alzheimer's disease. Precisely this relationship has
> now been reported in numerous epidemiological studies, including
> those individuals suffering from sleep disorders such as insomnia
> and sleep apnea.

> [k3016] But we had to wait until the advent of brain-imaging
> machines in the early 2000s before we could reconstruct glorious,
> three-dimensional visualizations of brain activity during REM
> sleep. It was worth the wait. Among other breakthroughs, the method
> and the results undermined the postulates of Sigmund Freud and his
> nonscientific theory of dreams as wish fulfillment, which had
> dominated psychiatry and psychology for an entire century. There
> were important virtues of Freud's theory, and we will discuss them
> below. But there were deep and systemic flaws that led to a
> rejection of the theory by modern-day science.

> [k3160] Nevertheless, the psychoanalytic method built on Freudian
> theory is nonscientific and holds no repeatable, reliable, or

> [k3226] Concentrations of a key stress-related chemical called
> noradrenaline are completely shut off within your brain when you
> enter this dreaming sleep state. In fact, REM sleep is the only time
> during the twenty-four-hour period when your brain is completely
> devoid of this anxiety-triggering molecule.

> [k3273] Sleep, and specifically REM sleep, was clearly needed in
> order for us to heal emotional wounds.

> [k3285] Cartwright had shown that it was not enough to have REM
> sleep, or even generic dreaming, when it comes to resolving our
> emotional past. Her patients required REM sleep with dreaming, but
> dreaming of a very specific kind: that which expressly involved
> dreaming about the emotional themes and sentiments of the waking
> trauma.

> [k3301] The theory proposed that a contributing mechanism underlying
> the PTSD is the excessively high levels of noradrenaline within the
> brain that blocks the ability of these patients from entering and
> maintaining normal REM-sleep dreaming.

> [k3321] It turns out that the drug prazosin, which Raskind was
> prescribing simply to lower blood pressure, also has the fortuitous
> side effect of suppressing noradrenaline in the brain. Raskind had
> delightfully and inadvertently conducted the experiment I was trying
> to conceive of myself. He had created precisely the neurochemical
> condition--a lowering of the abnormally high concentrations of
> stress-related noradrenaline--within the brain during REM sleep that
> had been absent for so long in these PTSD patients.

> [k3732] While the reasons remain unclear, insomnia is almost twice
> as common in women than in men, and it is unlikely that a simple
> unwillingness of men to admit sleep problems explains this very
> sizable difference between the two sexes. Race and ethnicity also
> make a significant difference, with African Americans and Hispanic
> Americans suffering higher rates of insomnia than Caucasian
> Americans--findings that have important implications for
> well-recognized health disparities in these communities, such as
> diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, which have known
> links to a lack of sleep. In truth, insomnia is likely to be a more
> widespread and serious problem than even these sizable numbers
> suggest.

> [k3754] The two most common triggers of chronic insomnia are
> psychological: (1) emotional concerns, or worry, and (2) emotional
> distress,

> [k3781] Simply put, the insomnia patients could not disengage from a
> pattern of altering, worrisome, ruminative brain activity.

> [k4252] Many people enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, even an
> aperitif thereafter. But it takes your liver and kidneys many hours
> to degrade and excrete that alcohol, even if you are an individual
> with fast-acting enzymes for ethanol decomposition. Nightly alcohol
> will disrupt your sleep, and the annoying advice of abstinence is
> the best, and most honest, I can offer.

> [k4329] Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more
> deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.

> [k4686] Interestingly, participants in the above studies do not
> perceive themselves as applying less effort to the work challenge,
> or being less effective, when they were sleep-deprived, despite both
> being true. They seemed unaware of their poorer work effort and
> performance--a theme of subjective misperception of ability when
> sleep-deprived that we have touched upon previously in this book.

> [k4898] Teton County in Wyoming enacted an even more dramatic change
> in school start time, shifting from a 7:35 a.m. bell to a far more
> biologically reasonable one of 8:55 a.m. The result was
> astonishing--a 70 percent reduction in traffic accidents in sixteen-
> to eighteen-year-old drivers.

> [k4990] Additionally, after a thirty-hour shift without sleep,
> residents make a whopping 460 percent more diagnostic mistakes in
> the intensive care unit than when well rested after enough sleep.
