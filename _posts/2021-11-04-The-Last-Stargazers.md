The Last Stargazers is an excellent story of Emily Levesque's path to
passion for astrophysics and astronomy. I related to it, because at a
young age, I got rapture of the bits, just as she as she was star
struck. And, the story is written extremely well even if you aren't a
nerd.

As a nerd, though, I enjoyed her fun anecdotes: telescopes getting
shot at, tarantulas in the control room, and almost breaking a 600
ton telescope. From past to future, the history of modern astronomy is
told with whit and charm. I'm sure it will be a book that turns kids
on to astronomy.

> [k61] "Have you tried turning it off and back on again?"

> [k65] Second, the equipment in question was the Subaru Telescope, a
> 630-ton beast housed one floor above my head in a fourteen-story dome.

> [k106] If I called off the night, I'd be giving up what could well be my
> only opportunity to ever study these galaxies, losing a linchpin of my
> thesis research in the process.
>
> Of course, having the largest piece of
> glass in the world sitting in pieces on the dome floor wouldn't help
> matters either.

> [k135] I was becoming an astronomer because I wanted to explore the
> universe and learn the stories of the night sky; beyond those broad
> strokes, I wasn't particularly fussed with what the exact job description
> of "astrophysicist" entailed.

> [k138] I did not daydream about being the final decision point for
> keeping one of the world's largest telescopes intact.

> [k205] I'd been enraptured by space for as long as I could remember, but
> the original spark could be traced back to early 1986, when Halley's
> Comet made its most recent close flyby of the earth.

> [k215] In keeping with their lifelong habits, once my parents got __into__
> something, they were into it, full bore. When that something was
> astronomy, my dad scraped up funds to buy a backyard Celestron C8, a
> squat orange cylinder with an eight-inch mirror, and built his own table
> to mount it on along with some added shelving to store eyepieces,
> equipment, and a copy of __Norton's Star Atlas__.

> [k301] Things like engineering or biology at least had obvious endpoints
> and employment options, but none of us, myself included, had much idea of
> where the career path for a physicist, let alone an __astrophysicist__, would
> head.

> [k365] Arriving at MIT, I was delighted to be surrounded by the
> camaraderie of a few thousand other science-loving geeks and immediately
> declared myself a physics major. There was just one catch: I'd never
> actually taken a physics class before.

> [k377] Physics, as it turned out, was __hard__. __Really__ hard.
>
> My only consolation was that it at least appeared to be hard for
> everyone.

> [k394] MIT was my first real indication that the road to brilliance
> sometimes took a few turns that steered well clear of common sense.

> [k426] It took just one night of observing for me to get hooked. I loved
> it.

> [k494] Dinner on Kitt Peak wrapped up in time for everyone to head
> outside and watch the sunset together before scattering to the telescope,
> a time-honored tradition of astronomers everywhere.

> [k515] At age eighty-six, George was nominally retired but in the
> uniquely academic sense of the word: he may have sported a professor
> emeritus designation, but he still came to work at the University of
> Washington astronomy department almost daily.

> [k693] The methods for doing this can be as primitive as a reinforced
> board stretched between two walkways, as was the case for the
> thirty-six-inch telescope at Lick Observatory in central California.
> There, an observer would reach the walkway, then straddle the board and
> scoot out into the center of the dome, a solid thirty feet above the
> floor, to reach the prime focus cage.

> [k712] Winter nights were indisputably the best for observing from a
> scientific perspective--the nights were long and dark, the cold air crisp
> and clear--but the misery of spending ten hours shivering away at the
> prime focus couldn't be denied.

> [k875] Few people today mourn the loss of fiddly and hard-to-quantify
> photographic plates, frigid hours in a cold dome, or men-only observatory
> dorms.

> [k1055] Chile is unarguably the telescope capital of the world; there are
> so many observatories scattered throughout the western foothills of the
> Andes that many can be spotted from another observatory's summit.

> [k1094] So after being assigned a night--if you're lucky--based on moon
> phase, existing travel plans, and the season when your targets are
> observable, you're left hoping that on your specific evening, there'll be
> no wind, no rain, no fog, no low clouds, no high clouds, and if the
> planet's atmosphere could stay as still as possible over your
> mountaintop, that'd be great too.

> [k1247] The 3:00 a.m. haze in particular is what makes music choice
> utterly critical to observing runs. Almost any astronomer you ask will
> tell you that playing the right music is a vitally important ingredient
> for any observing run, to the point that it acquires an almost talismanic
> quality.

> [k1264] Astronomers span an impressively broad range of music tastes.
> (It's also worth noting the disproportionate number of astronomers with
> some degree of musical training, ranging from casual hobbyists to
> astronomer and rock star Brian May, the guitarist for Queen.)

> [k1290] riot of stars overhead on a Southern Hemisphere night is
> spectacular, particularly for those of us used to the north. Thanks to
> the tilt of the earth's axis, northern locales see the outskirts of our
> Milky Way, while those lucky enough to be in the south are looking
> directly toward the star-stuffed center of the galaxy.

> [k1299] In a place as dark as Las Campanas, the net effect is a sky so
> rich with stars, it's nearly three-dimensional.

> [k1370] Meyer-Womble Observatory in Colorado, near the summit of Mount
> Evans in the Rocky Mountains at 14,148 feet, was bombarded by wind gusts
> as high as 95 miles per hour during the winter of 2011.

> [k1374] (The story ended sadly. After years of effort to replace the dome
> and battles with contractors, the University of Denver, faced with a lack
> of sufficient support for restoring the dome, recently decided to
> demolish and remove the telescope.)

> [k1548] Pete was an operator for the 300 Foot radio telescope at Green
> Bank, nestled in the midst of the United States National Radio Quiet Zone
> in West Virginia.

> [k1766] Altitude alone can be hazardous. At many thousands of feet above
> sea level, astronomers often grapple with the physical effects of the
> thin air. Splitting headaches, dizziness, exhaustion, and impaired
> judgment are all unwelcome symptoms in the midst of trying to perform
> challenging scientific research.

> [k1901] There's rarely a sign that lights up for women and blinks out
> THIS IS SEXISM. THIS PERSON IS BEING SEXIST RIGHT NOW.

> [k1968] The discovery spawned entire new subdisciplines of physics, and
> Vera went on to eventually win just about every prestigious prize offered
> to a professional astronomer (with the exception of the Nobel in Physics,
> which has long had a sizeable blind spot for groundbreaking research done
> by women).

> [k1985] When I first entered the field, it was all too easy to convince
> myself that gender must have very little to do with astronomy.
>
> When I
> first heard stories of Ann and Vera and their contemporaries, my brain
> reflexively placed them in ancient history.

> [k1994] Astronomy is undeniably different today; according to the
> American Institute of Physics, women earned 40 percent of the 186
> astronomy PhDs awarded in 2017. However, the improvement in gender
> representation is still starkly absent along other axes. Women may have
> represented 40 percent of the doctoral degrees awarded in 2017, but
> Hispanic women comprised only 4 percent, and African American women made
> up 2 percent.
> The 2007 Nelson Diversity Survey found that among the top forty
> astronomy departments in the United States, only 1 percent of professors
> of any gender were Black and another 1 percent were Hispanic.

> [k2009] The Hubble Space Telescope recently switched to a dual-anonymous
> system in its yearly review of observing proposals after an internal
> study found that success rates were consistently lower for proposals led
> by women than those led by men; after removing names from the proposals,
> the percentile difference between genders disappeared.

> [k2079] Finally, observatory mountaintops can have spiritual and cultural
> significance to local indigenous populations.

> [k2168] Thayne Currie saw it differently. An astronomer working on Mauna
> Kea and the Big Island in 2015, he was a staunch supporter of building
> the TMT but also adamant that astronomers should advocate for and justify
> their plans to anyone who would listen.

> [k2172] His sense was that many of the protestors' actions stemmed from a
> sincere desire to protect Mauna Kea, and he earnestly believed that
> communication and compromise, with both sides willing to listen to each
> other, was the only acceptable way forward.

> [k2225] In a community that so deeply values the planet we're on, the
> summits we visit, and the human curiosity we bring to the skies, I have
> to hope we can find a way to respect and share our own humanity, our
> knowledge of the cosmos, and our love for the mountains that make our
> work possible. They're the windows we're able to climb to that give us a
> glimpse of the universe.

> [k2416] The slowest pulsars emit a few radio pulses per minute, while the
> fastest emit hundreds of pulses in a single second, spinning faster than
> a hummingbird beats its wings. The discovery was recognized with a Nobel
> Prize (although once again, the committee avoided giving the prize to a
> woman, instead recognizing her thesis adviser and another colleague), and
> Jocelyn went on to a long and distinguished research career, receiving a
> 2018 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics to recognize her
> scientific achievements.

> [k2889] Still, when I raised the subject, most people's first instinct
> was to talk about the beauty, the emotion, the almost spiritual
> ethereality of the whole event.
>
> Astronomers' understanding of the
> mathematical poetry and scientific elegance behind an eclipse seemed to
> only deepen their ability to soak up its beauty.

> [k3825] Since I'd just slammed enough caffeine to jump-start a wooly
> mammoth, I was left twitching in my living room, geared up for an
> observing run that was almost certainly not going to happen. Lesson
> learned: coffee __after__ confirming the night is on.

> [k3840] Amid the day-to-day normalcy of your own couch or office, it's
> all too easy to lose track of the reality that your occasional clicks and
> keystrokes on a computer screen are actually physically __moving__ a many-ton
> instrument thousands of miles away.

> [k3882] It's an undeniably luxurious way to observe. Waking up to a
> bundle of new data in your email inbox is certainly more restful than
> powering through the 3:00 a.m. haze and patchy clouds in the hopes of
> maybe squeezing out whatever scraps of data you can manage on your
> preassigned night. At the same time, queue observing removes the
> astronomer from their observations by one more degree.

> [k3909] I'd heard from someone that another queue-based telescope in
> Chile prevented visiting astronomers from so much as touching the
> telescope controls: everything was done by the operators and telescope
> staff. Supposedly, they'd installed a switch labeled "astronomer" for
> visiting classical observers to use that could be flipped back and forth
> but wasn't actually attached to anything. Its main purpose was to give
> the people who'd insisted on being present for their observations
> something to do.
