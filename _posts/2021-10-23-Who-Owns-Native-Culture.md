> themselves citizens.

> [k312] A right to cultural privacy is presented as self-evident and
> morally unassailable, even if its scope remains unspecified.

> [k416] Privacy rights, for example, cannot be transferred to others, and

> transferred to third parties and passed to succeeding generations.
> Nevertheless, a tidy separation of property and privacy is impossible
> within a market system that turns identity into a commodity.

> [k866] If the USPTO were to declare tribal insignia equivalent to other
> government symbols, as some Indian activists demand, then tribes would be
> unable to license them for commercial use, thereby losing a potential
> source of income.

> [k903] "If the federal government or the global community would provide a
> different kind of protection for Aboriginal cultures, then we'd use that.
> We did what we had to do given the resources that were available.
> If the global community would come together as effectively to
> protect our intellectual property rights as they've come together to
> protect Coca-Cola or Microsoft, we wouldn't use the trademark.
