By Hakeem M. Oluseyi and Joshua Horwitz, Ballantine Books, June 15, 2021, 1984819097

Hakeem Oluseyi's memoir reads like a novel. It's full of action,
heart-break, and triumph. I read it in a few sittings, and finished it
by reading late into the night.

I read this on the recommendation of
[Dan Abell](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dan-Abell).
Dan is a physicist at RadiaSoft, and we are in a social justice group
sponsored by the company.
[RadiaSoft takes Social Justice very seriously](https://www.radiasoft.net/about/social-justice/).
I must say I have my doubts, but the books that have been recommended
to me have been very eye opening. A Quantum Life is an excellent book.

I simultaneously enjoyed and struggled with the book, because Oluseyi
went to Stanford, and it brought back a lot of memories of
Stanford. But it was different for him. He had to struggle with so
many challenges I never had. I have been very fortunate, and he
worked his ass off to get to Stanford. I can't fathom it all,
frankly.

> [k330] Houston was the first place I got a peek at how white folks lived.
> My best friend that year was a white boy named Bobby, who lived down the
> street. I liked to hang at his house because his family would sit down to
> eat together at dinnertime, and afterward they would sit around and play
> card games or watch TV. Nobody shouted or hit anyone. At least, not in
> front of me.
>
> Bobby's parents taught me how to play bridge, which came
> easily and naturally to me, even though I was just six.

> [k340] Bobby's parents made a big fuss about my excellence at bridge.

> [k342] Since Daddy Robert was gone out to sea most of the time, we were
> eating out of cans and boxes again. But Bobby's family used to eat raw
> vegetables cut up into bite-sized pieces that you dipped in blue cheese
> dressing.

> [k345] I soaked up all the white-folk stuff like it was a secret language
> from a parallel, but alien, universe that I wasn't supposed to speak
> anywhere else.

> [k356] Every whipping--like the one she gave me after she came home to
> find me taking apart her makeup mirror with the fluorescent lights around
> the edge--came with a scolding she delivered in time with the whipping:
> "Why is you" (whip) "always" (whip) "breaking shit" (whip)?!

> [k362] The other thing that reliably got me a whipping were my
> experiments.

> [k403] That's how it went with Mama. She was either tired or sad or
> angry--or else she was full of fun.

> [k477] Mama used to tell me and Bridgette, "No matter how bad it gets for
> us, we ain't nearly as bad off as some o' those other folks." Standing
> there in Now and Later's living room, I thought to myself, These are
> those other folks. Everything about that room and the people in it just
> cried out "bad" and "sad."

> [k500] When the house was empty of food, we'd put mayo or ketchup on
> bread and call it a sandwich. Syrup sandwiches were my favorite.

> [k502] In a house with ten mouths, being the youngest meant a hunger
> hole in my belly most of the time.

> [k791] I'd sit with the latest Ohio Players double album open on my lap
> and propped up at just the right angle to let the weed stay in place and
> the seeds and stems slide down the cardboard.

> [k900] But my eyes didn't tear up until the scene when his owner took
> away the last thing Kunta still had from his African home to call his
> own: his name. That made me fighting mad. Being James Plummer Jr. made me
> feel special, and I didn't know what I'd do if anyone tried to take that
> away from me.

> [k942] The racial split wasn't just on the playground. All the white kids
> sat together with their plastic-wrapped sandwiches in fancy lunch boxes.
> Boys had either Batman or Spider-Man that year, and the girls were deep
> into the Partridge Family. We Black kids sat together and ate our free
> lunch off of plastic trays.

> [k949] By the spring of fourth grade I'd worked my way up from the fourth
> to the first track and was the first to complete all the work. I felt
> pretty good about that, even though my white teacher put me down by
> saying, "James, your handwriting looks like chicken scratchin'." And just
> in case I was thinking of acting uppity, she pointed to the white kid who
> finished second and said, "Sarah was more careful and made fewer
> mistakes."

> [k1381] I felt safer going solo.
>
> So I learned to survive on my own,
> living by my wits and my fists. I learned that it was best to hit first,
> hit hard, and to never stop hitting. I learned that if I intimidated the
> other guy first, he wouldn't intimidate me.

> [k1479] By the end of the summer I was leading adult Bible classes too,
> even though I was only thirteen.

> [k1626] Smoking weed marked the start of my double life, which required a
> steady supply of Visine and breath mints.

> [k1633] Half the time the teachers were teaching stuff wrong. And when I
> corrected them, they immediately bounced me out of class and sent me to
> the vice principal's office.

> [k1714] She brought the Datsun to a stop in front of a new brick house.
>
> "We visitin' someone?" I asked.
>
> "This is our new house, baby. Your
> stuff's in back," she said, motioning toward the trunk. When I gave her a
> puzzled look, she squealed out loud, "My FHA loan came through, baby. We
> homeowners now!"

> [k1723] Every kid looks forward to moving up from middle to high school.
> But when I arrived at Heidelberg High, I felt like I'd taken the elevator
> from the basement to the ground floor.
>
> Back in the 1980s, Mississippi
> seemed to compete with Alabama to see which state could spend the least
> amount of money on education, and whose students could score the lowest
> on standardized tests.

> [k1955] I'd won first place in Physics--and a big-ass trophy that proved
> I could bend spacetime just enough to make Mississippi stop and take
> notice of my beautiful Black mind.

> [k1963] By sophomore year at Heidelberg, Mr. Cross was letting me
> orchestrate and choreograph our football halftime shows.

> [k1973] At the end of band camp, they held an awards banquet. I came in
> second place for the Students' Choice Award, which totally shocked me. It
> was basically a popularity contest, and I had no idea that people beyond
> my immediate friend group liked me.

> [k2004] Faced with my first conversation ever with a white girl, I was
> too shocked and suspicious to speak. Smiling white girls luring you to
> your death was exactly the scenario I'd been warned against growing up.

> [k2106] Best takeaway: I learned to keep my clothes and gear clean and
> tidy.

> [k2108] The navy also taught me what institutional racism looked like
> from the inside.

> [k2225] The social front wasn't any more inviting than the lecture hall.
> I'd never met Black kids like the students at Tougaloo--raised up inside
> middle-class families with educated parents.

> [k2322] As the big brothers explained to us: if we could survive pledge,
> we could thrive in the world as brothers. Hazing was framed for us as a
> metaphor for the trial that America's race-based social hierarchy had in
> store for us once we graduated into adult life.

> [k2557] I couldn't be a real father to my son. I was ashamed and
> miserable. I responded the only way I knew how--by self-destructing.

> [k2600] Daddy didn't have to tell us to keep our heat out of sight. We
> understood you don't pull a gun out to show it. That just escalates a
> situation. You only pull it out to shoot, and only if you have to.

> [k2694] The most brutal and recurrent feeling in the life of a crack
> smoker is the moment the rocks run out.

> [k2717] "Plummer, you changing, man. You gon' shoot some strung-out dude
> over forty dollars? C'mon, now. That's some fiendish shit. That ain't
> you, man."

> [k2760] She may have been a top-twenty student at Natchez High School and
> done okay at Tougaloo, but now that she was in school outside the Black
> community, with higher academic expectations, she realized her
> educational background was sorely lacking. I once saw an essay she'd
> written, and I was shocked. She wrote at what seemed to me a sixth-grade
> level.

> [k2790] I got an A in calculus that term, and more important, I learned
> the value of not just working through problems but __talking__ through them
> with a partner--which would continue to be my best strategy for learning
> difficult material and solving problems in any subject.

> [k2877] "Don't shrink from this moment. History awaits you. Get your PhD.
> Apply to the astronaut program. And for God's sake, keep moving forward.
> We need you. America needs you. The Black community needs you."

> [k2930] No one had ever shown me that level of trust, whether I'd earned
> it or not. I'd always been treated--certainly by most white folks in
> authority--like a suspected criminal. Yet this guy trusted me. And we'd
> just met!

> [k2938] This whole business of trust and autonomy was huge for me.

> [k2960] Outside on the streets of Athens people in passing cars might
> yell out "Nigger!" or throw stuff at my head. But inside Dr. Duncan's
> lab, no one was out to get me. I didn't feel belittled or looked down on.
> I felt safe, and valued.

> > [k3137] If learning the truth is the scientist's goal, then he must make
> > himself an enemy of all that he reads. He should also suspect himself, so
> > that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.
> > --Ibn Al-Haytham (1030 ce), mathematician, astronomer, and inventor of the scientific method

> [k3174] It was clear that I was the odd man out among my fellow grad
> students. Every year, the Stanford physics department took in one student
> like me--a diversity admission who wasn't at the same level of academic
> preparation as the rest of the class.

> [k3177] I was the exotic and endangered species of wannabe physicist in
> my class.

> [k3201] They definitely considered themselves the smartest dudes in the
> joint, and it was our job to figure out how to operate on their level. As
> far as I could see, they saw their job as giving you a chance to watch
> them be brilliant up close--not to actually teach you the material.

> [k3205] At Tougaloo, the professors never assigned the hardest problems.
> At Stanford, that's all they assigned.

> [k3640] [Art Walker, said "]The Air Force was happy to have me doing research in their
> weapons lab, but they weren't handing out leadership positions to men who
> looked like me. I had to put in my time, and then some, to earn my way
> up. So don't think this is going to get easier anytime soon. Physics is
> difficult to begin with. And it may be hard, or impossible, to convince
> some of the faculty you belong here. But you're a smart guy. That's
> why we wanted you in our program. I believe in you. I believe you
> can put this behind you and make it through."

> [k3715] The only other crack user in the group was a normal-ass-looking
> white woman. That's the first thing I learned in rehab: addiction wasn't
> a Black thing.

> [k3717] The second thing I learned was that I couldn't get sober on my
> own--any more than I could get through my physics coursework without a
> study group.

> [k3759] Paul, Gavin, and I quickly became a power study group. Four
> nights every week we got together at Paul's place and worked on the
> problem sets. Not only was I learning physics at a new level, I
> discovered that when we worked together, I could stand toe-to-toe with
> Paul and Gavin.

> [k3844] One day when we were sitting courtside, I asked him if he'd
> decided on an area of research yet. It turned out he'd already teamed up
> with Professor Robert Wagoner, a theoretical particle physicist and
> cosmologist whose book __Cosmic Horizons__ had famously reconstructed the
> chemical makeup of the primordial universe, circa the Big Bang.

> [k4262] "Here's what happened," [Daveed] explained.
> "You needed to pass five of the eight parts. You passed four passed
> four parts straight-out--include the three toughest: the two Quantum
> plus Stat Mech. You had a high enough score on the fifth
> section--but then Romani
> moved the goalposts so you'd fall outside the curve, and fail."

> [k4270] "I don't care what anyone says," Marcia said to me. "You did not
> fail that exam. I was there in the room with the committee. They violated
> the rules to fail you. But Daveed defended you for passing the hardest
> sections and I worked out a compromise with Romani. So don't you worry
> about it. Art will have your back."
>
> "What's he gonna do?"

> [k4287] "Understand this. An organization of people is like a bell
> curve," said Art, citing a fundamental principle from probability theory.
> "In the center of the curve are the vast majority of people. They're
> indifferent. Apathetic. They're thinking of themselves. Then there is a
> small minority of people who will extend a helping hand to you. They will
> work with you, share resources with you. And there's another small
> minority that is going to be hostile to you. Don't let that small group
> of doubters derail you."

> [k4293] "Let me ask you a question," Art said. "How do you think the
> faculty treats me? Do you think they give me credit for my
> achievements?"
>
> "Well, yeah," I said. "You are a full professor."
>
> "And yet many of them still question my intelligence. They can
> never accept that a Black man is their intellectual equal or that you and
> I can make an original contribution."

> [k4342] Art wasn't one of those professors who socialized with his
> students or invited them over to his house for barbecues.

> [k4358] Then one day I ran into Victoria [Art's wife] at the Safeway and decided to
> broach the subject. I told her I'd noticed Art wasn't his usual
> high-energy self.

> [k4362] She must have seen the concern on my face, because she took my
> hand when she said, "Last month, Art was diagnosed with stage four
> pancreatic cancer."

> [k4411] Having a role model for both manhood and a life in science was
> huge for me. But it wasn't the same as becoming a man, or a scientist. To
> do that, I still had to slay the demons who'd been chasing me since
> childhood. I had to unlearn my ingrained survival reflex to go tough and
> self-protective whenever I felt vulnerable or worthless.

> [k4416] Back when I was at Tougaloo, I'd read the basic canon of
> Afrocentric literature. At Stanford, I became determined to discover how
> my people and I ended up at the bottom of America's identity hierarchy.

> [k4423] When I decided to change my name, it had nothing to do with
> rejecting the religion I was raised in, or my daddy, or my past.

> [k4424] For me, changing my name was about staking a claim to my
> identity.

> [k4426] I decided to change my name as a matter of choice and
> self-determination.

> [k4431] If I could one day make a significant contribution to science, I
> wanted people to know, just from hearing my name, that I was a Black man,
> descended from Africa.

> [k4443] All my life I'd been told that to be accepted by whites as an
> equal, a Black man had to prove himself twice as good. That was cutting
> it way too close, if you asked me.
