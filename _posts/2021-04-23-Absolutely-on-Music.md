I really wanted to like Absolutely on Music, but I found it too slow paced, even
boring. The music terminology got too technical at times for me. I
didn't finish it.

> [k106] Basically, I believe that music exists to make people happy.

> [k140] Creative people have to be fundamentally egoistic. This may sound
> pompous, but it happens to be the truth. People who live their lives
> watching what goes on around them, trying not to make waves, and looking
> for the easy compromise are not going to be able to do creative work,
> whatever their field.

> [k167] Like Ozawa, I also get up at four in the morning and concentrate
> on my work, alone.

> [k588] OZAWA: You know how people say that the sound of an orchestra
> changes with the conductor? That tends to be truer of American
> orchestras.
