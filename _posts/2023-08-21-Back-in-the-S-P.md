[I bet it all on Amazon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-07-21-Betting-on-Amazon %})
starting in July 2020. By February 2022, I realized I just didn't have
the stomach for it. It was a big bet. During that period, I lost 3.0%
[AIRR](https://www.bivio.com/site-help/bp/Investment_Performance_Report_Help),
and the S&P 500 gained 20.6% (AIRR), or a cummulative 40.6% loss in
comparison to the S&P 500.

"Ouch!" is what I say after three years.

However, if I had stayed in Amazon until today (August 2023), the AIRR
would be -4.4% in comparison 16% for the S&P 500. Total cummulative
loss would have been 46.1%. Yay!

## Jump In!

For those of you who know me, I jump in to pretty much anything I do
with all four paws. It sometimes hurts a lot, and other times, it
feels great.

I don't think of myself as impulsive. I think things through as best
as I can, and then I decide. If I had decided to keep half in the S&P
500 and half in Amazon, I would have fared better, of course. That's
just not me.

Long ago, Warren Buffett said, "Consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost
index fund. I think it's the thing that makes the most sense
practically all of the time."

I think I am finally done trying to beat the advice of the Oracle of
Omaha.
