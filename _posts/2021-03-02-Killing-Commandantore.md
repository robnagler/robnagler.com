Killing Commendatore is one of my favorite Haruki Murakami stories.
I'm a Murakami fan, and I guess I like all his stories. I end up
identifying with his narrators. With this book, I listened to some of
the same music that the narrator was listening to while reading the
book. That was fun.

Murakami describes the world so well. Even the technical parts didn't
bother me, because he didn't go into too much detail yet enough to
make it interesting.

> Do you think that's unnatural?"
