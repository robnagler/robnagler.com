By Walter Isaacson, Simon & Schuster, March 9, 2021, 1982115866

Walter Isaacson is brilliant writer. The Code Breaker is filled with
an amazing amount of detail, and weighs in at 500 pages, but I
finished it in five days. Normally, it would take me a month. I just
couldn't put the book down at times.

Jennifer Doudna is the star of the book, but she's a (competitive)
team player. If you're on her team, awesome. If not, well, things
might get ugly. I'm not personally like that, but I appreciate her
drive to win. And that she did.

The book taught me a great deal about CRISPR. It's not a textbook, but
it's close. It piqued my (on-and-off-again) interest in
biochemistry. If you don't know anything about biochemistry, you
should read this book. It'll teach you why it's important, and how it
works, to some degree.

The part that most amazes me about Isaacson is that he is able to
synthesize a thesis about the need for us to understand biochemstry
and why. His philosophical analysis is spot on imho. He ends the book
with very astute thoughts that you might be able to read standalone,
but really should be read in the context of understanding gene
editing.

The book is topical: COVID-19 is featured. RNA is the protagonist, in
a way. It's necessary to understand why RNA is so important in order
to understand how the vaccines and cures have been rapidly
achieved. CRISPR, too, is key, because it wasn't invented but
discovered. Evolution honed during the last billion years on
earth. We're just repurposing it to chop up bad genes (virii) or
replace them in the human genome to fix problems, such as sickle cell
anemia, with somatic cell edits, or someday, permanently with germline
(inheritable) edits.

> [k691] Szostak had a guiding principle:
> __Never do something that a thousand other people are doing__.
> That appealed to Doudna.

> [k719] As a young PhD student, Doudna mastered the special combination of
> skills that distinguished Szostak and other great scientists: she was
> good at doing hands-on experiments and also at asking the big questions.
> She knew that God was in the details but also in the big picture.
> "Jennifer was fantastically good at the bench, because she was fast and
> sharp and could seemingly get anything to work," Szostak says. "But we
> talked quite a bit about why the really big questions are the important
> questions."

> [k752] Doudna would stay in touch with Watson, attending many of the Cold
> Spring Harbor meetings he organized. Over the years, he would evolve into
> an increasingly controversial character because of his unmoored blurtings
> about racial genetic differences. Doudna generally refrained from letting
> his behavior diminish her respect for his scientific achievements. "When
> I saw him, he often would say things he thought were provocative," she
> says with a slightly defensive laugh. "That was his way. You know how it
> is." Despite his frequent public comments about women's looks, beginning
> with Rosalind Franklin in __The Double Helix__, he was a good mentor to
> women. "He was very supportive to a close woman friend of mine who was a
> postdoc," Doudna says. "That influenced my opinion of him."

> [k759] Ever since she puzzled over the
> touch-sensitive leaves of the sleeping grass that she found on her walks
> as a child in Hawaii, Doudna had been passionately curious about the
> underlying mechanisms of nature.

> [k765] Wielding imaging techniques such as X-ray crystallography, which
> is what Rosalind Franklin used to find evidence of the structure of DNA,
> structural biologists try to discover the three-dimensional shape of
> molecules.

> [k811] Doudna's mission when she arrived at the University of Colorado as
> a postdoc was to map the intron that Cech had discovered could be a
> self-splicing piece of RNA, showing all of its atoms, bonds, and shapes.

> [k828] One breakthrough came as a result of the random things that often
> happen in science: a slight blunder, like the mold that got on Alexander
> Fleming's Petri dishes and led to the discovery of penicillin. One day a
> technician was working with Doudna to try to make crystals, and she put
> the experiment into an incubator that was not working properly. They
> thought the experiment was spoiled, but when they looked at the samples
> through a microscope they could see crystals growing. "The crystals had
> RNA in them and were beautiful," Doudna recalled, "and that was the first
> breakthrough showing us that to get these crystals we had to elevate the
> temperature."

> [k969] Throughout the history of life on our planet, some organisms
> (though not humans) have evolved ways to use RNA interference to fight
> off viruses. As Doudna wrote in a scholarly publication back in 2013,
> researchers hoped to find ways to use RNA interference to protect humans
> from infections. Two papers published in __Science__ that year gave strong
> evidence that it might work. The hope then was that drugs based on RNA
> interference might someday be a good option for treating severe viral
> infections, including those from new coronaviruses.

> [k1015] But he knew that bacteria and archaea have small amounts of
> genetic material. They cannot afford to waste a lot of it on sequences
> that have no important function.

> [k1043] What he found was intriguing: the spacer segments matched
> sequences that were in viruses that attacked __E. coli__. He found the same
> thing when he looked at other bacteria with CRISPR sequences; their
> spacer segments matched those of viruses that attacked that bacteria.

> [k1058] Mojica found that bacteria with CRISPR spacer sequences seemed to
> be immune from infection by a virus that had the same sequence. But
> bacteria without the spacer did get infected. It was a pretty ingenious
> defense system, but there was something even cooler: it appeared to adapt
> to new threats. When new viruses came along, the bacteria that survived
> were able to incorporate some of that virus's DNA and thus create, in its
> progeny, an acquired immunity to that new virus.

> [k1063] But Mojica had a ridiculously difficult time getting it
> published.

> [k1195] By 2008, scientists had discovered a handful of enzymes produced
> by genes that are adjacent to the CRISPR sequences in a bacteria's DNA.
> These CRISPR-associated (Cas) enzymes enable the system to cut and paste
> new memories of viruses that attack the bacteria. They also create short
> segments of RNA, known as CRISPR RNA (crRNA), that can guide a
> scissors-like enzyme to a dangerous virus and cut up its genetic
> material. Presto! That's how the wily bacteria create an adaptive immune
> system!

> [k1243] Starter cultures for yogurt and cheese are made from bacteria,
> and the greatest threats to the $40 billion global market are viruses
> that can destroy bacteria.

> [k1491] "She definitely doesn't hover over you," says Wilson, who now
> runs his own Berkeley lab aligned with Doudna's, "but when she goes over
> your experiments and results with you, there are times when she will
> lower her voice a bit, look you right in the eye, lean in, and say, 'What
> if you tried...?' " Then she would describe a new approach, a new
> experiment, or even a big new idea, usually involving some new way of
> deploying RNA.
>
> One day, for example, Wilson came to her office to show
> some results about how two molecules that he had crystallized interacted.
> "If you can disrupt this interaction based on knowing how it works," she
> said, "maybe we can make that same disruption inside the cell and see how
> it changes the behavior of the cell." It pushed Wilson to move beyond the
> test tube and delve into the inner workings of a living cell. "I would
> never have thought of doing that," he says, "but it worked."

> [k1502] Although she takes a hands-off approach during the early stages
> of a researcher's project, as it gets close to fruition she engages
> intensely. "Once something exciting emerges or a real discovery is in the
> works, she senses when it's a big deal and she gets super involved," says
> Lucas Harrington, one of her former students.

> [k1505] She doesn't want another lab to beat hers to a discovery.

> [k1569] By the time Doudna and Haurwitz started their company in 2011,
> Berkeley had become savvier about encouraging its researchers to be more
> entrepreneurial.

> [k1581] That led her to join a local professional development group for
> young CEOs, the Alliance of Chief Executives, which met for a half-day
> each month to share problems and solutions. It's hard to imagine Steve
> Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg joining such a support group, but Haurwitz, like
> her mentor Doudna, had a self-awareness and humility not usually found
> among alpha males.

> [k1584] Today the mere appearance of the word CRISPR in a prospectus is
> enough to cause venture capitalists to go into heat. But when Doudna and
> Haurwitz tried to raise money, they had little luck.

> [k1590] Its bootstrap success may, on the surface, make Caribou
> Biosciences seem like a poster child for pure free-market capitalism.

> [k1588] None of the venture capitalists they met with was a woman, and
> this was in 2012. So instead of continuing to seek venture money, they
> decided to raise what they could from friends and family. Both Doudna and
> Haurwitz put in their own money.

> [k1596] [Vannevar] Bush's recommendation was that government should not build big
> research labs of its own, as it had done with the atomic bomb project,
> but instead should fund research at universities and corporate labs.

> [k1603] In addition, Caribou itself was able to get a federal grant from
> the NIH's small business innovation program, which provided $159,000 to
> the company to create kits to analyze RNA-protein complexes. The program
> was designed to help innovators turn basic research into commercial
> products. It kept Caribou alive during the early years, when venture
> funding was not forthcoming.

> [k1667] "It's important to know how to be an outsider," Charpentier says.
> "You're never completely at home, and that can drive you. It can
> challenge you not to seek being comfortable."

> [k1682] Researchers had shown that if you deactivated Cas9 in bacteria,
> the CRISPR system no longer cut up the invading viruses.

> [k1690] It turns out that tracrRNA performs two important tasks. First,
> it facilitates the making of the crRNA, the sequence that carries the
> memory of a virus that previously attacked the bacteria. Then it serves
> as a handle to latch on to the invading virus so that the crRNA can
> target the right spot for the Cas9 enzyme to chop.

> [k1799] "Once we figured out the components of the CRISPR-Cas9 assembly,
> we realized that we could program it on our own," Doudna says. "In other
> words, we could add a different crRNA and get it to cut any different DNA
> sequence we chose."

> [k1822] He also discussed the idea with Chylinski, and they quickly
> designed a series of experiments. Once they had figured out what parts of
> the two RNAs could be deleted and how they could be connected, it took
> only three weeks to make a single-guide RNA that worked.

> [k1832] Realizing that it would have implications for a possible patent
> on gene-editing technology, he told her that she needed to have it
> written up fully in the lab notebook and witnessed. So Jinek went back to
> the lab that night and wrote a detailed description of their concept. It
> was close to 9 p.m., but Sam Sternberg and Rachel Haurwitz were still
> there. Lab notebooks have witness signature lines at the bottom of each
> page in order to document important advances, and Jinek asked both of
> them to sign. Sternberg had never been asked to do that before, so he
> realized that it was a historic evening.

> [k1856] At Doudna's urging, the editors fast-tracked the review process.
> She knew that other papers on CRISPR-Cas9, including one from a
> Lithuanian researcher (more on him in a moment), were already
> circulating, and she wanted to make sure that her team was the first to
> publish. The editors at Science had their own competitive motivation:
> they didn't want to be scooped by a rival journal. They asked CRISPR
> pioneer Erik Sontheimer to be one of the reviewers and told him he would
> have to get his comments back in two days, an unusually fast turnaround.
> He declined the assignment because he was doing his own work on the
> topic, but the journal's editors were able to find others to review the
> paper quickly.

> [k1898] By February 2012, he had produced a paper, with Barrangou and
> Horvath as secondary authors, that described how, in a CRISPR system, a
> Cas9 enzyme was guided by a crRNA to cut up an invading virus. He sent it
> off to the journal __Cell__, which summarily rejected it. In fact, the
> journal did not deem the paper interesting enough to send out for peer
> review. "Even more frustrating, we sent it to __Cell Reports__, which is kind
> of a sister journal to __Cell__," Siksnys says. "They
> rejected it too."

> [k1909] The fact that Doudna subsequently hurried to push her own team's
> paper into print would cause a small controversy, or at least a few
> raised eyebrows, among some members of the CRISPR crowd. "You should look
> at the timing of Jennifer's patent filing and the submission of her paper
> to __Science__," Barrangou told me. At first glance, it can look suspicious.
> Doudna got Siksnys's abstract on May 21, and she and
> her colleagues filed a patent application on May 25 and submitted their
> paper to __Science__ on June 8.

> [k1978] Barrangou, the Danisco researcher who had been a collaborator on
> Siksnys's paper, later said that, as soon as he heard
> the presentation, he knew that Doudna and Charpentier had taken the field
> to a whole new level. "Jennifer's paper was clearly so much better than
> ours," he admits. "It wasn't close. It was the tipping point that moved
> the CRISPR field from an idiosyncratic interesting microbial-world
> feature to a technology. So Virginijus and I, we had no hard feelings
> whatsoever."

> [k2009] The road to engineering human genes began in 1972 when Professor
> Paul Berg of Stanford discovered a way to take a bit of the DNA of a
> virus found in monkeys and splice it to the DNA of a totally different
> virus.


> [k2011] Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen discovered ways to make these
> artificial genes more efficiently and then clone millions of copies of
> them.

> [k2012] It took another fifteen years before scientists began to deliver
> engineered DNA into the cells of humans. The goal was similar to creating
> a drug. There was no attempt to change the DNA of the patient; it was not
> gene __editing__. Instead, gene therapy involved delivering into the
> patient's cells some DNA that had been engineered to counteract the
> faulty gene that caused the disease.
>
> The first trial came in 1990 on a
> four-year-old girl with a genetic mutation that crippled her immune
> system and left her at risk for infection. Doctors found a way to get
> functioning copies of the missing gene into the T cells of her blood
> system. The T cells were removed from her body, given the missing gene,
> and then reintroduced into her body. This led to a dramatic improvement
> of her immune system and allowed her to live a healthy life.

> [k2032] The invention of gene editing required two steps. First,
> researchers had to find the right enzyme that could cut a double-strand
> break in DNA. Then they had to find a guide that would navigate the
> enzyme to the precise target in the cell's DNA where they wanted to make
> the cut.

> [k2044] With ZFNs and TALENs, you had to construct a new protein guide
> every time you wanted to target a different genetic sequence to cut; it
> was difficult and time consuming. But with CRISPR you merely had to
> fiddle with the genetic sequence of the RNA guide.

> [k2052] This rather quick success could be taken as evidence, as Doudna
> and her colleagues would later argue, that making CRISPR-Cas9 work in
> human cells was an easy and obvious step that was not a separate
> invention. Or it could be used to argue, as Doudna's competitors have,
> that it was a major inventive step that came after a fiercely competitive
> race.

> in molecular biology.

> [k2138] "I was excited to discover that animals could be a programmable
> system," he says. "That meant human genetic coding could be programmable
> as well." It was more exciting than Linux.

> [k2146] Zhang's Saturday teacher helped him get selected to spend his

> Des Moines. As a high school student, he worked under a psychologically
> intense but very personable molecular biologist named John Levy, who
> explained over tea each day the work he was doing and assigned Zhang to
> increasingly more sophisticated experiments.

> [k2165] Zhang was at Harvard at the same time as Mark Zuckerberg, and
> it's interesting to speculate on which of them will end up having the
> most impact on the world.

> [k2167] Majoring in both chemistry and physics, Zhang initially did
> research with Don Wiley, a crystallographer who was a master at
> determining the structure of complex molecules.

> [k2170] But in November of Zhang's sophomore year, Wiley mysteriously
> disappeared one night while attending a conference at St. Jude's
> Children's Hospital in Memphis, leaving his rental car on a bridge. His
> body was later found in the river.
>
> That year Zhang also had to help a close friend in his class
> who was spiraling into major depression.

> [k2175] The experience caused Zhang to turn his attention to researching
> treatments for mental illness.

> [k2189] Fortunately, he was working in the most exciting lab at Harvard
> Medical School, which was run by a professor who was beloved for
> embracing new ideas, sometimes wildly, and who fostered a jovial
> atmosphere that encouraged exploration: Doudna's longtime friend, the
> avuncular and bushy-bearded George Church, one of the contemporary
> legends of biology and a scientific celebrity. He became for Zhang, as he
> did for almost all of his students, a loving and beloved mentor--until
> the day Church believed that Zhang had betrayed him.

> [k2201] Although he is personable and charming, Church has the
> literalness often found in successful scientists and geeks. At one point
> we were discussing some decision that Doudna had made, and I asked him
> whether he thought it had been necessary. "Necessary?" he replied.
> "Nothing is necessary. Even breathing is not necessary. You can even stop
> breathing if you really want to." When I joked that he had taken me too
> literally, he remarked that one reason he is a good scientist, and also
> thought of as a bit of a madman, is that he questions the necessity of
> any premise. He then wandered off into a discourse on free will (which he
> doesn't believe humans have) until I was able to get him back on track
> talking about his career.

> [k2237] He went on to Duke, where he earned two undergraduate degrees in
> two years and then skipped ahead into a PhD program. There he stumbled.
> He became so involved in the lab research of his advisor, which included
> using crystallography to figure out the three-dimensional structure of
> different RNA molecules, that he stopped going to classes. After failing
> two of them, he got a letter from the dean coldly informing him, "You are
> no longer a candidate for the Doctor of Philosophy degree in the
> department of Biochemistry at Duke University." He kept the letter as a
> source of pride, the way others keep their framed diplomas.

> [k2725] The decision not to pool the CRISPR-Cas9 intellectual property
> would pave the way for an epic patent battle. It also would end up
> hampering the easy and widespread licensing of the technology. "I think
> in retrospect, if I had to do it over again, I would have licensed it
> differently," Doudna says. "When you have a platform technology like
> CRISPR, it's probably a better idea to license it in a way that offers it
> as broadly as possible." She had no expertise with intellectual property,
> and she was at a university that didn't have much either. "It was kind of
> like the blind leading the blind," she says.

> [k3011] The article helped to draw the battle lines in the CRISPR war.
> Doudna's admirers at Harvard, led by Church and her PhD advisor, Jack
> Szostak, were infuriated. "It's just an awful, awful, piece of writing,"
> Szostak tells me. "Eric wants the credit for the genetic editing
> revolution to go to Feng Zhang and him, and not Jennifer. So he just
> totally belittled her contribution in a way that seems just pure animus."

> [k3195] Would Doudna and Zhang have been better off coming to a deal
> rather than battling in court? In retrospect, Doudna's business partner
> Andy May thinks so. "We would have saved a lot of time and money around
> all of the legal arguments if we had managed to come together," he says.
>
> To an unnecessary extent, the prolonged fight was driven by emotions and
>  resentments.

> [k3201] Unlike the CRISPR contestants, Noyce and Kilby obeyed an
> all-important business maxim: __Don't fight over divvying up the proceeds

> [k3273] Even though the genetic cause of sickle-cell disease has been
