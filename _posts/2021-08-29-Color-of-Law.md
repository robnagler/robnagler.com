title: "BookNotes: The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America"

By Richard Rothstein, Liveright, May 2, 2017, 1631492853

The Color of Law describes the history of de jure segregation in the
US. Richard Rothstein wrote this book to counter the Supreme Court
ruling in 2007 that segregation was caused by "societal
discrimination" and "not traceable to [government's] own actions".
The book documents his case clearly, and I agree with him: the US,
state, and local governments kept Blacks from buying homes and living
where they wanted to.

The laws created were terrible. We know about redlining, but did you
know Black soldiers who fought in World War II could not buy homes
with VA loans? Horrible.

I lived in East Meadow, NY in Levitt house that was purchased by my
(White, Jewish, WWI veteran) father with a VA loan. He would not have been
able to afford the house with that loan. We had no Black
neighbors. Not that we could buy a home in Levittown, because their
covenant restricted Jews from buying there. I don't know why East
Meadow didn't have such a covenant, but I'm grateful they didn't have
one. I just wish anybody who wanted to could have lived where I
did.

This is an important and compelling book. Hopefully, it will bring
change. Just after I finished this book, California just passed a law to return
[Bruce's Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce%27s_Beach) back to
the family of its original Black owners.

> [k154] The core argument of this book is that African Americans were

> [k294] To ensure that no African Americans migrated to Richmond unless

> American men on the street and then arrested and jailed them if they
> couldn't prove they were employed.

> [k326] As in Rollingwood ten years earlier, one of the federal
> government's specifications for mortgages insured in Milpitas was an
> openly stated prohibition on sales to African Americans.

> [k372] At the time, the Federal Housing Administration and Veterans
> Administration not only refused to insure mortgages for African Americans
> in designated white neighborhoods like Ladera; they also would not insure
> mortgages for whites in a neighborhood where African Americans were
> present.

> [k375] State-regulated insurance companies, like the Equitable Life

> Within six years the population of East Palo Alto was 82 percent

> from other neighborhoods doubled up in single-family homes.
> Their East Palo Alto houses had been priced so much higher than

> payments without additional rental income.
> Federal and state housing policy had created a slum in East Palo
> Alto.

> [k422] The federal government first developed housing for
> civilians--living quarters on military bases had long been in
> existence--during World War I, when it built residences for defense
> workers near naval shipyards and munitions plants. Eighty-three projects
> in twenty-six states housed 170,000 white workers and their families.
> African Americans were excluded, even from projects in northern and
> western industrial centers where they worked in significant numbers.

> [k433] The administration constructed separate projects for African
> Americans, segregated buildings by race, or excluded African Americans
> entirely from developments.

> [k439] A TVA official explained that the town was being reserved for
> whites because "Negroes do not fit into the program."

> [k454] Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, who directed the effort,
> had been president of the Chicago branch of the National Association for
> the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the 1920s and was one of the
> administration's few liberals on racial matters.
>
> Although most officials intended public housing for middle- and
> working-class white families, Ickes's efforts resulted in African
> Americans occupying one-third of the units, an unprecedented government
> commitment to the housing needs of African Americans. But Ickes did not
> propose to integrate PWA developments. Of the PWA's forty-seven projects,
> seventeen were assigned to African Americans. Six others were segregated
> by building. The rest were for whites only.

> [k482] When the federal government objected to the city's failure to
> accommodate African Americans, St. Louis agreed to a blacks-only project
> as well.

> [k512] Certainly, many urban areas already had distinct African American
> neighborhoods when the PWA or USHA came on the scene; federal agencies
> cannot be charged with sole responsibility for segregation. But they
> reinforced it.

> [k518] It would be going too far to suggest that cities like these would
> have evolved into integrated metropolises were it not for New Deal public
> housing. But it is also the case that the federal government's housing
> rules pushed these cities into a more rigid segregation than otherwise
> would have existed.

> [k540] In 1935, the Cambridge Housing Authority, in cooperation with the
> PWA, demolished a low-income tenement neighborhood that had been
> integrated, mostly by African Americans and European immigrants. There
> the authority built Newtowne Court, restricted to white tenants.

> [k578] The Western Addition had been a mixed community, including a large
> Japanese American population. But when the federal government relocated
> Japanese-origin families to internment camps, their residences were
> vacated, and African Americans were able to rent them, making this one of
> the few San Francisco neighborhoods where African Americans could find
> housing.

> [k583] In 1942, the San Francisco authority announced its resolve to
> maintain segregation by unanimously adopting a resolution: "In the
> selection of tenants . . . [we shall] not insofar as possible enforce the
> commingling of races, but shall insofar as possible maintain and preserve
> the same racial composition which exists in the neighborhood where a
> project is located."

> [k685] In his ruling, the district judge who originally heard the case
> wrote, "No criterion, other than race, can plausibly explain the veto of
> over 99.5% of the housing units located on the White sites which
> were originally selected on the basis of CHA's expert judgment and at the
> same time the rejection of only 10% or so of the units on Negro sites."

> [k703] In Miami, for example, African Americans eligible for public

> dispersal throughout the community. It was not until 1998 that civil
> rights groups won a requirement that vouchers be offered to African
> Americans as well--too late to reverse the city's segregation.

> [k805] In 1913, Wilson and his cabinet approved the implementation of
> segregation in government offices.

> [k807] Black supervisors were demoted to ensure that no African
> American oversaw a white employee.

> [k942] In 1924, two years after the advisory committee had published its

> adopting a code of ethics that included this warning: "a realtor should
> never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood . . . members of
> any race or nationality... whose presence will clearly be detrimental to
> property values in that neighborhood."

> [k959] The judge explained, "The blighting of property values and the

>
> In the years since the 1926 Supreme Court ruling, numerous white

> [k979] My purpose, however, is not to argue courtroom standards of proof.

> [k988] Studies by the Commission for Racial Justice of the United

> was 89 percent higher than the national median.

> [k1118] Although the HOLC did not always decline to rescue homeowners in

> [k1131] Appraisers were told to give higher ratings where "[p]rotection

> [k1150] All had good credit ratings, and banks were willing to issue

> [k1172] There he caught the attention of railroad tycoon August Belmont

> [k1175] He found lodging in Hempstead, not far from the racetrack, and

> [k1213] By 1950, the FHA and VA together were insuring half of all new

> [k1219] Levittown was a massive undertaking, a development of 17,500
> homes. It was a visionary solution to the housing problems of returning
> war veterans--mass-produced two-bedroom houses of 750 square feet sold

> [k1222] Instead, Levitt built the houses and then sought customers. He

> [k1235] The FHA even withheld approval if the presence of African
> Americans in __nearby__ neighborhoods threatened integration.

> [k1241] As William Levitt testified before Congress in 1957, "We are 100
> percent dependent on Government."

> [k1263] But because De Porres was intended for African Americans,
> Vatterott could not get FHA financing for it.

> [k1565] The full cycle went like this: when a neighborhood first

>
> Falling sale prices in neighborhoods where blockbusters

> [k1587] In Mark Satter's time, approximately 85 percent of all property

> [k1768] In 2000, 41 percent of all borrowers with subprime loans would

> [k1786] Bank supervisors instructed their marketing staffs to target

> [k1919] Hundreds, if not thousands of smaller acts of government
