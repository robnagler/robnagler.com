This was going to be a simple article about how to build
[Goblin's BandBox](https://www.goblinsgym.com/bandbox.pdf), which is a
clever of exercise equipment created by
[Pascal Dornier](https://www.instagram.com/goblinsgym/). The dice of
life didn't roll as I had hoped. What follows includes the
instructions and my quixotic quest for perfection. It
even involves a car chase.

### Goblin's BandBox

I have been expanding my home gym. I want to do trap bar deadlifts,
but I don't want a big trap bar and weights just for deadlifts. One
way to do this is resistance bands.

My friend Devon whom I recently visited likes to travel light and uses
resistance bands exclusively for working out. He's in great shape so I
thought I'd try them, too.  I tried deadlifting with just my feet and
then a board under my feet to hold down the resistance bands, but it
was awkard.

Then I discovered Goblin's BandBox.  You can watch
[Pascal in an instructional video](https://youtu.be/iMhuDaR_hwU?si=KNiFkt-9So77Klh7)
to see how it works. Very cool. He even provides an
[instruction manual](https://www.goblinsgym.com/bandbox.pdf).

{: #finished-bandbox}
Here's what mine looks like from the top:

[![Finished BandBox Top](/assets/i/20240428/finished-bandbox-top.jpg){: width="600"}](/assets/i/20240428/finished-bandbox-top.jpg)

And, the bottom:

[![Finished BandBox Underneath](/assets/i/20240428/finished-bandbox-under.jpg){: width="600"}](/assets/i/20240428/finished-bandbox-under.jpg)

You might see some flaws. There are many others. It makes me sad to
look at it, because I worked very hard to get here. The important
thing I have to remember is that it works well, and I don't have to
have a trap bar and plates.

### BandBox Fixation

One alternative to the BandBox is to use a board with feet, which you
[can buy for $300](https://wittersmanufacturing.com/shop/ols/products/the-masterplate).
Some people use a
[cutting board and hockey pucks](https://youtu.be/tmEIG3b0-8Q?t=173s). However,
Goblin's BandBox is better and allows for other activies like side
pulls.

My BandBox fixation became acute. I sought out what Pascal calls "idle
rollers", which are called "gravity rollers" in the US. I should
mention that Pascal is Swiss, and you might notice the quality of the
rollers. I wanted to find those, and I couldn't. I honed in on
[15 inch rollers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XNN8PGY) after a bit,
and ordered those. Pascal
[said](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResistanceBand/comments/xna9bd/comment/iptedso/)
it is hard to find those, but that wasn't the hard part for me.

The most difficult piece to source was the anti-slip phenolic resin
plywood, which I could only find in 4x8 sheets and nothing
local. (While finding links for this article, I ran into
[this on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/563485077/anti-slip-mesh-phenolic-birch-plywood),
which would have been a good option. Buffalo board is not a name I had
seen before, and that's a good one to search for in the US.) I have a
[plyo box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZRCCNM9) which is made out of
the same anti-slip plywood. I figured this was going to be my
cheapest and easiest option so I ordered one.

All of this researching took quite a bit of time. I was quite fixated
on making the best possible BandBox, of course. I'm glad the research
phase was over.

### First Sketch

The rollers arrived. They were solid and work well. I started my first
sketch:

[![First BandBox Sketch](/assets/i/20240428/sketch-1.jpg){: height="400"}](/assets/i/20240428/sketch-1.jpg)

The initial depth (height in the sketch) was going to be 19 inches
which was large. The rollers are very long, and this meant the whole
box was going to be quite large. I wasn't happy with the net weight of
the end product either. I felt like there had to be a better solution.

That's when I did even more research to figure out a better
solution. I get kind of lost in these research activities so I spent
way more time than I needed to. A
[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResistanceBand/comments/xna9bd/comment/ipwrygj/)
mentioned PVC and dowels instead of rollers. This is what I ended up
using. I'm happy with the solution, because it's not as deep (16
inches) or as heavy (no weight, sorry).

### Wood Fixation

The box hardware stores have crappy 2x4s. They are quite uneven or
damaged on one side. I spent too long go through stacks of 2x4s trying
to find the "right one". I ended up buying a stair tread, something
I've used before. They have to be straight and clean or people are
going to trip. They are typically 1 inch thick, which was *almost*
perfect. I had to compromise.

This meant cutting a 1 inch piece of wood straight. These are the side
pieces of the BandBox and they have to be level so the box sits flat
and so the cross piece (where you place your feet) is level. I figured
the first cutting experiment was in order. You can see the left over
piece of stair tread in the first picture. My cuts without a table
saw or guide rail were too uneven to work well. And anyway, 1 inch
was a little narrow for dowel/PVC holes.

There are many lumber places near where I live so I out driving near
one and stoped by.  pretty quiet outside, and of course, it was just
the warehouse (thanks Google Maps!). They said the store was actually
5 miles away. There were others nearby, but I decided to call
first. Nobody had clean 2x4 pine in stock. Everybody in Denver
recommends [Austin Hardwoods](https://www.austinhardwoods.com), which
I decided was too out of the way.

o  cut my wood fixation short, I was in Boulder and went to
[Sterling Lumber](https://sterlinglbr.com) (locals know this as
Boulder Lumber). They had very nice maple 1x4s so I bought 9 feet had
them cut it in half to fit in my car, and went home.

### Crooked Wood

The maple cost $50 ($5.50 per linear foot) so I figured it *had* to be
straight. My motto: cut twice, measure once. I should have
checked. The piece was warped, and my idea of screwing two pieces of
wood together to form a 2x4 was going to take some work.

Aside. When you buy dimensional lumber in the US, e.g. 2x4s and 1x4s,
you get something less than advertised. A 1x4 is really .75 by 3.5
inches. A 2x4 is really 1.5 by 3.5 inches. You can't be annoyed by
this, but you need to take this into account.

Interestingly, the single 1x4 was actually not 3.5 inches
wide. Rather, it was slightly tapered. This might not matter if you
are building something, but it was off enough that I was also going to
have a sanding job to even out the pieces for solid support.

I figured that it wouldn't be too bad to screw and glue the wood
together so end wood fixation. All wood was good. Time to cut, I mean,
measure.

### Second Sketch

I ended up with 1.25 inch oak dowels. The PVC tubing is labeled as 1
1/4, which is actually 1.375 inch so a 1.25 inch dowel fits perfectly
for smooth rolling. It was time for a second sketch:

[![Second BandBox Sketch](/assets/i/20240428/sketch-2.jpg){: height="400"}](/assets/i/20240428/sketch-2.jpg)

{: #pascals-sketch}
I was feeling quite good about the wood and dimensions. Things were
coming together. Take note of the quick three sets of parallel lines
where the three extra holes would go. I was following
[Pascal's diagram](https://www.goblinsgym.com/bandbox.pdf)
(included without permission):

[![Second BandBox Sketch](/assets/i/20240428/pascal-sketch.jpg){: height="250"}](/assets/i/20240428/pascal-sketch.jpg)

I'm referring here to holes 4A through 4F.

### Cut the Cake

This project was taking quite a bit of time, and I was starting to get
annoyed with my perfectionism. That's always a bad sign for me. I
needed to take some breaths. Thankfully Janis helped me see that the
product wasn't as important as the process. I actually like building
things, and well, I get upset at myself for taking so long doing
it. This is a common loop I get into. By writing this article, I hope
to help myself process this process.

The dowels were first. They had to be even, because they would form
part of the support of the box. I used a backsaw and cheap mitre box
that I've had for years. Oak is pretty tough to cut, and it took
longer than expected.

For the PVC, I broke out the reciprocating saw. The PVC was harder to
clamp so the backsaw wasn't going to work. Naturally in my carefulness
about the PVC I got my thumb between the back of the shoe and the
chassis. Ouch!

The maple boards were next, and they went smoothly. I was careful to
clamp them together so that the tow pieces would be the same length. A
little crooked on the end, since I was using a circular saw, free
hand.

### Puzzling over the Plyobox

The anti-slip plywood was next. I needed to figure out how to get the
right pieces out of the plyo box, which comes in six pieces with lots
of logos and holes in the wrong places. Here's a picture of the
[assembled plyo box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZRCCNM9) (included
without permission):

[![Yes4All 20x18x16 Plyobox](/assets/i/20240428/plyobox.jpg){: height="250"}](/assets/i/20240428/plyobox.jpg)

What I had failed to think about was the length of each piece was not
20 inches or 18 inches. I needed two pieces that were 8 x 16
inches. That meant the 16 inch piece was right out, and the 18x16
piece was the best choice.

I screwed the two faces together, checking carefully that I would
get minimal writing on the foot plate. After screwing together the
resin coated faces to avoid messing up the resin, I ended up with
this:

[![First foot plate](/assets/i/20240428/first-foot-plate.jpg){: height="250"}](/assets/i/20240428/first-foot-plate.jpg)

This made me happy despite a few imperfections in the resin. I was
annoyed, but I wasn't going to fuss over it.

### Sanding and Hands

The crooked maple pieces needed to be sanded to make them even. This
turned out to be quite a job. Maple is dense, and it takes a long time
to sand it down. I was using a vibrating sander which makes a mess,
and well, vibrates.

I had done all this in one day, because I wanted to be done with the
messy cutting and sanding. It was getting on 4 or 5 hours, which, back
in the day, would have been no problem for me. Given my age and lack
of recent woodworking, I should have not been surprised when my hands
cramped, like big time.

A month or so before I had the same thing happen after doing some
demolition work and using an angle grinder. After about 5 hours, my
hands completely seized up. I am somewhat ambidextrous with tools so I
switched off hands.

In the end, I had to accept the limits of my aging body, and stop for
the day. This was very frustrating, because there was plenty of
light and I wasn't ready to stop.

This fluke in my process really hit me hard. I don't like feeling my
age. I am generally fine with it, and I accept many limits. My hands
are the one thing that I worry about. I have an acquaintance who has
permanent
[trigger finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_finger). That's
not something I want to live with.

### Dowelry

With all pieces finally sanded, the next step was assembly. While I was happy
with the wood dowels, what I failed to think about was that the 1.25
inch dowels were quite wide. Remember holes 4A through 4F in [Pascal's
sketch](#pascals-sketch)? Well, it was going to be really hard to
achieve that.

In hindsight, I should have used two different sized dowels. A
BandBox's rollers need to be wide so the bands aren't pinched when
looping over the roller. However, the in between dowels are fixed, and
the bands aren't intended to move over them. I probably could have
gotten away with 1 inch dowels all around, or even .75 inch dowels for
the removable pins which help when doing one sided exercises.

### Third Sketch

The best plan was to include to have two holes underneat the foot
plates instead of three. Here's the quick sketch I did for thinking
this through:

[![Third BandBox Sketch](/assets/i/20240428/sketch-3.jpg){: width="600"}](/assets/i/20240428/sketch-3.jpg)

More compromises due to the randomness of the process. While it seemed
like I was planning thoroughly, I simply didn't have the experience to
know to plan this part out fully. I didn't want to sit in sketchup for
hours, and as it turns out, I'm glad I didn't. I was in for more
chaos.

### Hard Wood Drilling

Luckily my son has a drill press so I was able to cut precise holes in
the maple support pieces. I just needed to mark things out when I
realized that I had a 1 inch forstner drill bit and one that was 1.375
inches. The latter was what I was going to use for the holes for the
removable pins. That's why I bought 1.25 inch dowels in the first
place.

Off to the hardware store to buy a 1.25 inch forstner drill bit. That
was an ouch of about $20 that I hadn't planned for.

The drilling itself went quite well. I got the shopvac
out. Drilling large holes creates a lot of wood shavings. Drilling
into maple even more. The drill bit got hot. I would stop to vacuum up
the shavings. It was only after the third hole that I realized I could
hold the vacuum hose right next to the drill bit. I had done this in
the past, but being out of practice, I forgot. That made the mess
cleaner, but then I had to allow time for the bit to cool down.

It took about 5 minutes to drill one large hole. I had picked maple,
because I wanted it to look nice. It would have been much better to
use pine. Strong enough, and it would have looked as good as it needed
to. Drilling would have been faster and better.

The small holes for the screws were the worst. I should have regeared
the drill press, but I was too lazy. It went too fast and the wood
smoked. Going slowly didn't seem to help. The smaller bit got much
hotter, faster than the forstner bits, which have much more mass and
better contact with the drill chuck which also dissipates the heat.

I should mention that I clamped the two inner support pieces of wood
face to face to make the first set of holes. Once the two end holes
were cut, I could put in some leftover dowel pieces to ensure all the
dowel holes would align. Here's what the drilling looks like:

[![Drilling Support Pieces](/assets/i/20240428/drilling-side-pieces.jpg){: height="250"}](/assets/i/20240428/drilling-side-pieces.jpg)

### Assembly!

With all the pieces cut, sanded, drilled, and sanded (again), it was time to
assemble everything. This was an evening activity, because assembly is
always simple after the hard work above. Here are all the parts
beautifully arranged:

[![Unassembled Parts](/assets/i/20240428/tool-mess.jpg){: height="250"}](/assets/i/20240428/tool-mess.jpg)

Be sure to go back and look at the
[finished BandBox](#finished-bandbox) and compare the parts to see if
you can see a key difference between these parts and what finally got
assembled.

### Cluttered Work Area, Cluttered Mind

I was at this point getting annoyed with how long this project was
taking. I wanted to be done. Part of my frustration was that I don't
have a dedicated work bench any more, because we needed space in the
garage to protect both cars from hail storms. Now with only one car,
at least I have some space. Still, my work area was a mess:

[![Tools All Over the Place](/assets/i/20240428/tool-mess.jpg){: height="250"}](/assets/i/20240428/tool-mess.jpg)

Never the less, I decided to get started assembling.

I screwed the side pieces together, and I quickly realized that I
wasn't going to flatten the bent side pieces with screws. A couple of
screws broke so I was going to have to glue the pieces together. No
tragedy, and the end product would be stronger.

### Screw You Glue

Since the screws broke in the first attempts at assembly, I went to
the hardware store one more time to get better screws. Unlike the
selection of the wood, I rushed the process. I also didn't think
clearly. I bought some brass screws which looked better but were
actually *weaker* than the steel screws I was using. They were also
longer, which was good, but that made them even more likely to break
off.

When I was screwing the wood together after gluing and clamping, I
broke off a head in the side piece. This got me pretty flustered. I
should have known brass screws were weaker. I started beating myself
up pretty badly.

If you have read
[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]({{site.baseurl }}{% post_url 1991-12-31-Zen-and-The-Art-of-Motorcycle-Maintenance %}),
you will know that I was in a
[gumption trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance#Gumption_traps),
and more mistakes were going to be made. (Wait for it.)

Finally, the first side piece was glued, and I was ready to call it a
night.

### Devastation

As I mentioned, my garage was a mess. I needed a good place to put my
perfectly cut, drilled, and sanded pieces of wood that had yet to be
assembled while I was putting the one side piece together. What better
place than on top of the car? Not.

Yes, I forgot to move that off the car when I stopped in for the
night. That was my intention. And, yes, someone drove off with the
parts on top of the car the next day.

I just happened to go into the garage midday (the glue was still
curing), and I just happened to see a piece of wood on the car after
the car *was back*. Unbelievably, one of the two side pieces were on top
of the car after having been driven over five miles with two
stops. Don't ask me how.

If I hadn't seen that piece of wood at that time, I probably would
have completely chucked it in. As it was, I was completely devastated
by having to start over again. The one piece that was lost had 9 very
difficult to drill holes in it. I couldn't imagine matching it up to
the other side piece that was being glued.

### Car Chase

After much encouragement by Janis, I went outside to look for the
wood piece thing it had to have fallen off right next to the
house. What are the chances that it would be 2 miles away? Probably
pretty slim to none.

I came back in the house, and said I told Janis I couldn't find
it. Janis said, maybe it fell off nearby? I was distraught and angry
with myself. A great time to get into a car, I always say. Maybe I
should have grabbed a beer for the road.

No accidents, and yes, I found the other piece. It wasn't too beat up
either. Just some minor dings on the corners:

[![Damaged Side Piece](/assets/i/20240428/damaged-side-piece.jpg){: height="250"}](/assets/i/20240428/damaged-side-piece.jpg)

I still cannot fathom how it stayed on the car for over 3 miles. It
fell off in a very safe place (for a piece of wood) on an overpass
crossing I70 where there was a bit of shoulder, which no cars would
likely drive on. If you have done the math, it was on the way back
when it fell off, too.

The only word for this is a fluke, which also happens to be the name
of a
[book I recommend]({{site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-15-Fluke %}).
This is simply the law or large numbers at work.

### The Missing Piece

After gluing the other piece together, I was ready for to put it all
together. I just had to drill some holds in the edges to match up the
predrilled holes in the foot plates that were -- yes, you guessed it
-- were lost a few days before.

For some reason, it didn't occur to me that there were four pieces of
wood on top of the car: the two side pieces and the two foot
plates. The foot plates were gone, gone, gone. I was going out anyway,
and half-heartedly looked for them. Maybe they'll show up on my front
door (fluke!) some day.

However, I had to accept them as missing. This meant I had to use the
20x18 sides of the plyo box that I was holding in reserve. These are
the ones with the big Yes4All written across them.

### The Last Flaw, Not!

I matched up the pieces of wood carefully. Then I did the math, and I
said 20 minus 4 is 16, which is the length of the foot plate I
needed. I cut 4 inches off one side. When I went to cut the other
side, I realized that I had cut too much. Here's what it ended up
looking like in the [finished product](#finished-bandbox):

[![Incorrectly Cut Plyobox](/assets/i/20240428/incorrect-cut.jpg)](/assets/i/20240428/incorrect-cut.jpg)

I thought about buying a new plyo box, but that would have been $90. I
also thought I could replace the piece if someday I happened upon some
anti-slip phenolic resin plywood. However, there would be one more
flaw.

### Screwing Around

Did I mention I was rushing at this point? A big storm was coming in,
and I wanted to be done with the messy cutting parts that I wanted to
do outside. Definitely should have taken a breather, but I didn't.
Instead, I broke off several screw heads before I realized I was
trying to go too deep into the maple. It was not necessary. Here are
the last mistakes (afaik):

[![Incorrectly Cut Plyobox](/assets/i/20240428/broken-screws.jpg)](/assets/i/20240428/broken-screws.jpg)

Once I switched to shorter screws and drilled out the wood a couple of
times (till the smoke stopped pouring) that I ended up able to put in
the shorter (1.625 inch) deck screws without breaking
heads. Unfortunately, the broken heads mean that removing the oddly
cut foot plate is not going to be easy.

Good thing that the BandBox works as intended. Time to let quit
working wood and start working out!

### New Dimensions

I hope this story was entertaining. I rushed through it mostly to get
all the text written. I hope to get some edits from you, dear
reader. Unlike woodwooking, writing and software are much more
editable.

For those of you who want to attempt this, here are some dimensions on
the side pieces:

[![Inner Side Piece](/assets/i/20240428/inner-side-piece.jpg)](/assets/i/20240428/inner-side-piece.jpg)

The outside side pieces only have holes for the removable pins:

[![Outer Side Piece](/assets/i/20240428/outer-side-piece.jpg)](/assets/i/20240428/outer-side-piece.jpg)

Parts List (measurements in inches):

- (4) 1x4 board 25W (supports)
- (2) 5/8 anti-slip phenolic resin plywood 16L x 8W (foot plates)
- (4) 1 1/4 PVC 12.75L
- (4) 1 1/4 dowel 14.5L (support PVC)
- (2) 1 1/4 dowel 18L (removable pins)
- (8) 1 5/8 deck screws
- (10) 1 1/4 flathead wood screws

P.S. there were even more incorrect cuts, but I've already bored you enough.
