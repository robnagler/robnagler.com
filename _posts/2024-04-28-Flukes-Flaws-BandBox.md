This was going to be a simple article about how to build
[Goblin's BandBox](https://www.goblinsgym.com/bandbox.pdf), which is a
clever of exercise equipment created by
[Pascal Dornier](https://www.instagram.com/goblinsgym/). The dice of
life didn't roll as I had hoped. What follows includes the
instructions and my quixotic quest for perfection. It even involves a
car chase.

### Goblin's BandBox

I have been expanding my home gym. I want to do trap bar deadlifts,
but I don't want a big trap bar and weights just for deadlifts. One
way to do this is resistance bands.

My friend Devon whom I recently visited likes to travel light and uses
resistance bands exclusively for working out. He's in great shape so I
thought I'd try them, too.  I tried deadlifting with just my feet and
then a board under my feet to hold down the resistance bands, but it
was awkard.

Then I discovered Goblin's BandBox.  You can watch
[Pascal in an instructional video](https://youtu.be/iMhuDaR_hwU?si=KNiFkt-9So77Klh7)
to see how it works. Very cool. He even provides an
[instruction manual](https://www.goblinsgym.com/bandbox.pdf).

Here's what mine looks like from the top:

And, the bottom:

![Finished BandBox Underneath](/assets/i/20240428/finished-bandbox-under.jpg){: height="250"}

You should some flaws. There are many others. It makes me sad to look
at it, because I worked very hard to get here. The important thing I
have to remember is that it works well, and I don't have a trap bar.

### BandBox Fixation

One alternative to the BandBox is to use a board with feet, which you
[can buy for $300](https://wittersmanufacturing.com/shop/ols/products/the-masterplate).
Some people use a
[cutting board and hockey pucks](https://youtu.be/tmEIG3b0-8Q?t=173s). However,
Goblin's BandBox is better and allows for other activies like side
pulls.

My BandBox fixation became acute. I sought out what Pascal calls "idle
rollers", which are called "gravity rollers" in the US. I should
mention that Pascal is Swiss, and you might notice the quality of the
rollers. I wanted to find those, and I couldn't. I honed in on
[15 inch rollers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XNN8PGY) after a bit,
and ordered those. Pascal
[said](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResistanceBand/comments/xna9bd/comment/iptedso/)
it is hard to find those, but that wasn't the hard part for me.

The most difficult piece to source was the anti-slip phenolic resin
plywood, which I could only find in 4x8 sheets and nothing
local. (While finding links for this article, I ran into
[this on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/563485077/anti-slip-mesh-phenolic-birch-plywood),
which would have been a good option. Buffalo board is not a name I had
seen before, and that's a good one to search for in the US.) I have a
[plyo box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZRCCNM9) which is made out of
the same anti-slip plywood. I figured this was going to be my
cheapest and easiest option so I ordered one.

All of this researching took quite a bit of time. I was quite fixated
on making the best possible BandBox, of course. I'm glad the research
phase was over.

### First Sketch

The rollers arrived. They were solid and work well. I started my first
sketch:

![First BandBox Sketch](/assets/i/20240428/sketch-1.jpg){: height="250"}

The initial depth (height in the sketch) was going to be 19 inches
which was large. The rollers are very long, and this meant the whole
box was going to be quite large. I wasn't happy with the net weight of
the end product either. I felt like there had to be a better solution.

That's when I did even more research to figure out a better
solution. I get kind of lost in these research activities so I spent
way more time than I needed to. A
[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResistanceBand/comments/xna9bd/comment/ipwrygj/)
mentioned PVC and dowels instead of rollers. This is what I ended up
using. I'm happy with the solution, because it's not as deep (16
inches) or as heavy (no weight, sorry).

### Wood Fixation

The box hardware stores have crappy 2x4s. They are quite uneven or
damaged on one side. I spent too long go through stacks of 2x4s trying
to find the "right one". I ended up buying a stair tread, something
I've used before. They have to be straight and clean or people are
going to trip. They are typically 1 inch thick, which was *almost*
perfect. I had to compromise.

This meant cutting a 1 inch piece of wood straight. These are the side
pieces of the BandBox and they have to be level so the box sits flat
and so the cross piece (where you place your feet) is level. I figured
the first cutting experiment was in order. You can see the left over
piece of stair tread in the first picture. My cuts without a table
saw or guide rail were too uneven to work well. And anyway, 1 inch
was a little narrow for dowel/PVC holes.

There are many lumber places near where I live so I out driving near
one and stoped by.  pretty quiet outside, and of course, it was just
the warehouse (thanks Google Maps!). They said the store was actually
5 miles away. There were others nearby, but I decided to call
first. Nobody had clean 2x4 pine in stock. Everybody in Denver
recommends [Austin Hardwoods](https://www.austinhardwoods.com), which
I almost went to.

TO cut my wood fixation short, I was in Boulder and went to
[Sterling Lumber](https://sterlinglbr.com) (locals know this as
Boulder Lumber). They had very nice maple 1x4s so I bought 9 feet had
them cut it in half to fit in my car, and went home.

### Crooked Wood

The maple cost $50 ($5.50 per linear foot) so I figured it *had* to be
straight. My motto: cut twice, measure once. I should have
checked. The piece was warped, and my idea of screwing two pieces of
wood together to form a 2x4 was going to take some work.

Aside. When you buy dimensional lumber in the US, e.g. 2x4s and 1x4s,
you get something less than advertised. A 1x4 is really .75 by 3.5
inches. A 2x4 is really 1.5 by 3.5 inches. You can't be annoyed by
this, but you need to take this into account.

Interestingly, the single 1x4 was actually not 3.5 inches
wide. Rather, it was slightly tapered. This might not matter if you
are building something, but it was off enough that I was also going to
have a sanding job to even out the pieces for solid support.

I figured that it wouldn't be too bad to screw and glue the wood
together so end wood fixation. All wood was good. Time to cut, I mean,
measure.

### Second Sketch

I ended up with 1.25 inch oak dowels which worked well with 1.75 inch
(inner diameter) PVC tubing. It was time for a second sketch:

![Second BandBox Sketch](/assets/i/20240428/sketch-2.jpg){: height="250"}

I was feeling quite good about the wood and dimensions. Things were
coming together. Take note of the quick three sets of parallel lines
where the three extra holes would go. I was following

(included here without permission):

I'm referring here to holes 4A through 4F.

### Cut the Cake

This project was taking quite a bit of time, and I was starting to get
annoyed with my perfectionism. That's always a bad sign for me. I
needed to take some breaths. Thankfully Janis helped me see that the
product wasn't as important as the process. I actually like building
things, and well, I get upset at myself for taking so long doing
it. This is a common loop I get into. By writing this article, I hope
to help myself process this process.

The dowels were first. They had to be even, because they would form
part of the support of the box. I used a backsaw and cheap mitre box
that I've had for years. Oak is pretty tough to cut, and it took
longer than expected.

For the PVC, I broke out the reciprocating saw. The PVC was harder to
clamp so the backsaw wasn't going to work. Naturally in my carefulness
about the PVC I got my thumb between the back of the shoe and the
chassis. Ouch!

The maple boards were next, and they went smoothly. I was careful to
clamp them together so that the tow pieces would be the same length. A
little crooked on the end, since I was using a circular saw, free
hand.

### Puzzling over the Plyobox

The anti-slip plywood was next. I needed to figure out how to get the
right pieces out of the plyo box, which comes in six pieces with lots
of logos and holes in the wrong places. The

### Dowel size




It works great, and it allowed me to size the depth of the BandBox
more reasonably.





  Fixations hand cramp how to cut the wood fixation how to get the right
  roller
  Even fixation on this article
  flukes: happened to go outside, look at the car, within a given
  time, that one piece was still on the car, that the piece fell off
  in a large shoulder (not many shoulders on residential roads), etc.
  i was worried about the screw as being the main defect
  agonizing over screws
  that i saw the pvc recommendation in a reddit thread
  https://www.reddit.com/r/ResistanceBand/comments/xna9bd/comment/ipwrygj/
  decided to drop the rollers
  happened to see the brass screws; happened to go to ace
  happened to be in boulder so went to boulder lumber, board was bent
  and uneven width
  Do over smaller dowels for removable
  Mention buying rollers. Spent too much time on that
  Include pics of face to face black board
  Mention drill speed of bug holes
  Forstner bits in the picture with saws drills and drill press
  Sand then take pics
  Order of assembly





[I bet it all on Amazon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-07-21-Betting-on-Amazon %})
starting in July 2020. By February 2022, I realized I just didn't have
the stomach for it. It was a big bet. During that period, I lost 3.0%
[AIRR](https://www.bivio.com/site-help/bp/Investment_Performance_Report_Help),
and the S&P 500 gained 20.6% (AIRR), or a cummulative 40.6% loss in
comparison to the S&P 500.
