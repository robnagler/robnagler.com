By John le Carre, Viking, October 12, 2021, 0241994535

The last novel of le Carre, published posthumously. His son, Nick
Harkway (also a pen name) wrote a nice afterword about the book
needing only the lightest of edits. He wasn't sure why his father
didn't publish it during his life time.

Like all Le Carre novels, it's written well and intriguing. Very
enjoyable.
