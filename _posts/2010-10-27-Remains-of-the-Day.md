I read this eleven years ago. I remember it as an engaging
novel. Since reading it, Kazuo Ishiguro won the Nobel Prize for
Literature so I don't need to since the praises of this book, which
was once of his best novels.

Today (10/24/2021), I just finished
[The Murderbot Diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries).
The similarity in the language issues are striking. The Murderbot is
confused about human language, just as the character, Stevens does in
the Remains of the Day. Having lived in a foreign country myself, I
can relate.

> [k212] It is quite possible, then, that my employer fully expects me to
