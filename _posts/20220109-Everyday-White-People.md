Everyday White People Confront Racial and Social Injustice is about
the right length for me. I started feeling the repetition towards the
end.

The stories made me think about my White Privilege. I could write an
essay about the number of times I would get away with something that a
Black person would not. I made mistakes that would have landed a Black
man in jail. I've never been in jail, and I'm grateful for that. I
have never been hit by a police officer. There was one time where I
could have been, and I wasn't. There have been many times when I've
been approached by police for various violations and non-violations,
and I've always walked away.

And, I've done many things right that would have not been possible
without my White Privilege. I got into good schools. I got good
(enough) grades. I worked in various environments where there were no
black people. I still do, sadly.

I am "cultural Jew" (see below), but it has not been a hindrance in any
sense. I would argue, it was a great benefit. That's one thing I don't
like about this book. It should have been titled Everyday Jewish
People, because many of the stories (at least five) are by Jewish
people. Their Jewishness was central, in many ways, to their
story. I'm not sure what it says about the book, but the fact there
were so many Jews is just not "Everyday", statistically at least.

The authors talked about their oppressed identities, which I found
interesting. Most of the authors are women (another statisical
anomaly), and they talked about their feminism. The vast majority are
old, which is part of the book, I guess, in that these are
mini-memoirs.

I guess the title bothers me in other ways, too. The people are not
"everyday" in my sense of the word. I think of Studs Terkel
interviewees when I think of "everyday". These are all highly
privileged people who are recognizing some of their
privileges. Interestingly, none talked about their Intellect
Privilege. That's something I think about.

Despite all my complaining, I recommend the book, especially if you no
nothing about Social Justice work.

> [k905] My family was not very religious, but we were "cultural Jews."

> [k912] The message I internalized was that Jews were the universal
> scapegoat, and even when fully assimilated and successful, as they were
> in Germany prior to the rise of the Nazis, their safety was never secure.

> [k916] My great-grandmother Anna, for whom I am named, fled a small
> Russian village at the age of 16 to avoid an arranged marriage. She came
> to the United States to seek out a cousin who had immigrated earlier. Her
> parents disowned her, and she never spoke to them again; she later
> learned that her entire family perished in Nazi concentration camps. I
> realize how precarious my own existence is; were it not for random
> actions such as those by each of my great-grandparents, I would not be
> here today.

> [k935] I had trouble understanding how members of my own family could
> exhibit racist behaviors, given their own connections to oppression.

> [k939] I also grew up with a Black Jamaican maid.

> [k942] She had two children of her own who were close in age to my
> siblings and me. It wasn't until I was a teenager that I wondered if
> anyone was at home for them. I felt more and more uncomfortable as I
> recognized that my mother's own independence was predicated on the
> subordination of a Black woman.

> [k2029] I also keep learning about my sense of entitlement and how my
> white privilege allows me to take things for granted and be oblivious to
> the challenges faced by people of color. I remember when I was
> facilitating a workshop and I first told the story about how I would open
> up a bag of snacks in a store to taste them so I could decide if my kids
> would like them and how many I should buy. (I would always pay for
> whatever I opened.) Seeing the look of shock on the faces of the people
> of color, it dawned on me that my unconscious assumption that I could
> just sample food with impunity, because no one ever suspects me of any
> wrongdoing, was an expression of my white (and class and gender)
> privilege and sense of entitlement--of being a "nice white girl."

> [k2040] It takes courage to be a leader, to speak up, challenge the
> status quo, try new initiatives, put oneself out there. I struggle with
> this frequently, doubting the importance of what I have to say, worrying
> I will get it wrong, fearing judgment and ridicule. But if I expect
> others to take risks, I can expect no less of myself. "We can't teach
> what we don't know, and we can't lead where we won't go."

> everything comes down to relationships. What I care about, how I learn,
> my motivation to stay engaged, my ability to engage others, the support I
> get on my journey, opportunities for work, and the effectiveness of my
> change efforts are all connected to relationships with others. The more I
> do my own work (see previous guidepost), the stronger and more authentic
> those relationships can be.

> [k2059] I often think about and refer to the words of Pat Parker (1990)
