> [k680] To be assertive we have to think about the words we are using and
> express ourselves without either shrinking away or becoming aggressive.
> This is precisely what the stress response prevents us from doing well.

> [k743] Cognitive-behavioral theory suggests that we don't really react to
> what's going on around us. Instead, we react to what we think is going
> on.

> things, but by the views which they take of them."

> [k779] Cognitive therapists often use column-style forms as a way of
> exploring alternative ways of thinking.

> > [k780] In the first column you write down the situation. In the second,

> [k782] In the third column you say what you logically believe to be true

> [k786] Most of us have long-standing beliefs about ourselves, about
> assertiveness, and about social expectations that have an impact on the
> way we think in challenging interpersonal situations.

> [k849] The people around you may resist your efforts to become more
> assertive--even if it will help your relationships with them in the long
> run. Certain people in your social circle will try to push you back into
> your old way of relating, even if they used to complain about it.

> [k934] <FIXME 2022>Only set boundaries that you are willing and able to
> defend.

> [k936] <FIXME 2022>Don't start getting assertive when you are strained to
> the limit.

> [k1024] Do you live in the real world? The temptation is probably to
> answer "yes." Cognitive therapists believe, however, that the correct
> answer is "no."

> [k1029] We don't really react to what is going on in the real world; we
> react to what we think is going on.

> [k1033] Our thoughts are influenced by what happens in the real world,
> but our interpretations produce most of our reactions.

> [k1220] We willingly obey imaginary rules that dictate what we are and
> are not allowed to do.

> [k1422] When mistakes happen, remind yourself that you are supposed to be
> making them. Errors are vitally important. They are opportunities to
> fine-tune your skills.

> [k1528] The assertive style gets it right: We accept responsibility for
> our own behavior, we decide what we will and will not do, and we leave
> the behavior of others in their own hands.

> [k1532] We will constantly return to the idea of knowing the boundaries
> of our control. We are responsible for ourselves; others are responsible
> for themselves
>
> FIXME
> > [k1534] In fact, humor is often one of the most useful ways of being
> assertive without coming across to others as aggressive.

> [k1543] <FIXME 2022>Watch for hidden aggression in your own humor.

> [k1578] This guide is written from the perspective of North American
> culture.

> [k1582] What does not differ, however, is that some degree of assertive
> behavior is appropriate in virtually every culture.

> [k1615] When your verbal and nonverbal messages differ, your audience is
> more likely to believe the nonverbal message.
