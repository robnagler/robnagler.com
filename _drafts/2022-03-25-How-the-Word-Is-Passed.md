Brilliant, great writer. best social justice book i've read. not about
social justice per se. the descriptions were to so real. the people
were so real. the places. the way he touched on it all, including the
cemetery was execellent. the places he picked (the hardest part he
said). The idea of using places as a theme.

as a jew. we defended civil righs of blacks. i would say
disproportionately in comparison to non-jews. yet there is this
strange relationship between jews and black which i do not
undersatnd.

i think the holocaust could bring them together. i think the slavery
history. i think there is a common thread of suffering.

the difference between the holocaust and slavery is there was an
immediate truth and reconciliation (nuremberg) and reparations
(israel).

collective trauma builds. i know i suffer from the cossacks in my
history (keep your head down). every police beating brings it back for
blacks. every slight.

mchworter doesn't see this. i think he was the child of survivors like
viktor frankl, not liek the many others who suffered and had a lot of
anxiety. this is the difference.

Smith says the stories are still alive and they are. his grandparents
knew jim crow, lived it. they survived but many didn't and many
still suffer the collective trauma.

Therapeutic alienation is for some, but the culture was affected. You
can't just forgive and forget. That's not healthy. There has been no
truth and reconciliation. Just smatterings of apologies. No true
analysis like they did in Germany. You are ashamed of the holocaust in
Germany. Some arten't, but collectively they are. They are still
racist, but they keep it in check.
