I feel for Salim, the narrator. He is so vulnerable in
the book. He doesn't understand the world, naive. He wants to fit in
and do good at times (grateful). Others he rebels. He's learning to be
an adult. a coming of age story

It pleases us to read books about the lives of people outside our
circle. To glimpse but to not feel for real. Autobiographical but not
true. A fiction to live in words.

I am naive about Africa. I think of it as the dark
continent. The naive natives. Yet I am naive. The richness of the
culture. The depth of the dialogue. This book makes clear all that. I
am so naive.

Potent ending. Very sad. The book moved me in so many ways. I truly
identified with the main character, Salim, and his father (Baba). We
are so cruel to each other.

The corruption of power in Zanzibar also made me sad and angry.

The clever twist of the adopting the Measure for Measure plot, and I
just found out the name Gravel Heart came from a phrase in the play.

> [k399] The date on the photograph in the headmaster's office was December
> 1963, which would have been the end of the school year just before the
> revolution. Maalim Yahya lost his job soon after that, which was why he
> went to work in Dubai. The rest of the family, his wife and two
> daughters, followed but my father stayed behind. None of them ever came
> back while I was there, not even for a visit, and aside from that school
> picture I saw in the headmaster's office I had no image of my father's
> family. When I was very young, it did not occur to me that I should have
> one. My mother and my father were the world to me, and the snippets of
> stories I heard as a child sustained me even though the people they told
> of seemed so distant.

> [k488] Their grandmother was really their mother's aunt, but there was no
> word for that, only a description, so she became their grandmother, their
> Bibi. 'You can't imagine what that time was like,' my mother said,
> trying again to describe it. 'You cannot imagine the terror of it, the
> arrests, the deaths, the humiliations. People were driving each other mad
> with rumours of new outrages, new decrees, with news of further sorrows.
> But yes, you can imagine, you must try. Nothing stands between us and
> atrocities but words, so there is no choice but to try and imagine.'

> [k500] They learnt to avoid eye contact, to avoid provocation, to avoid
> looking at the acts of malice performed in plain sight.

> [k751] On reflection I think the story must have happened somewhere in
> Asia because there was a beautiful princess in it, and there was no story
> with a beautiful princess set in an African jungle.

> [k1051] The room was luxurious: a large bed, a dark wardrobe the depth of
> a coffin, a wide desk, a chest of drawers, a bookshelf, a comfortable
> reading chair, and still left enough space in the middle for a rug. A
> whole family lived in a room of this size where I had come from. I made a
> mental note of that as a line I would put in my first letter to my
> mother.

> [k1101] Uncle Amir's and Auntie Asha's fabled London life turned out to
> be frantic and I had to play my part in it and bustle about just like
> everyone else.

> [k1135] I reminded myself to be grateful. I went to college every day and
> attended all my classes. I looked after the children when required, gave
> them milk and biscuits when I was told to, and sat with them when their
> parents went out.

> [k1142] 'That grin has obliterated any sign of personality or style,' he
> told me. 'You look like a buffoon. Why are you grinning like that?' 'I
> don't know. I think cameras make me nervous,' I said. Uncle Amir looked
> at me with astonishment. 'Stop talking like a child,' he said.

> [k1149] After several weeks I found evening work in a supermarket and
> discovered unexpected satisfaction in stacking shelves and mopping
> floors. I did not at first understand
> FIXME

> [k1154] During vacations I worked in a warehouse as well and later in a
> launderette, turning myself into a migrant helot to show Uncle Amir and
> Auntie Asha that I deserved the good fortune they had granted me. In
> December it snowed.

> [k1171] I learnt to live with the cold and the dirt, and to evade the
> angry students at college with their swagger and their sense of grievance
> and their expectations of failure.

> [k1484] Mr Mgeni spoke to me in Kiswahili and I think that was part of
> the pleasure he took in telling me his stories. 'I don't have anyone I
> can speak to like this any more, not someone who will understand the
> language properly, without mangling it with Somali and Kikuyu, and slang
> and shang and who knows what words. It makes me so happy, to speak the
> old language and to use the big words with their flourishes and their
> yaanis and their graces.'

> [k1651] Homesickness sounds like a silly adolescent condition to be in,
> but there were times when it consumed me and paralysed me with sorrow and
> then I locked myself in my room and wept for hours.

> [k1734] When you told me to keep my ear close to my heart, I think it was
> to warn me against hard-heartedness. I think I have understood now.

> [k1747] had coveted the life of a student, the scholarly community,
> living on campus, attending seminars, but I found myself on the edges of
> this university life and hardly said a word in class. When I spoke it
> sounded wrong: not the grammar and the arrangement of words but something
> deeper, as if I was making things up and my stumbling efforts were
> evident to everyone. I did not have the self-possession of the other
> students and I felt uncomfortable among them.

> [k1788] I told her about things I found striking, about the little
> tangles I got into, about mishaps that had befallen me, and I made myself
> sound ridiculous and at odds with my circumstances, making myself into a
> joke, stumbling about in this new life I had worked so hard to arrive at.

> [k1793] My routine settled into such a pleasing pattern that I started to
> feel happy. I was required to read books that opened up the world for me
> and made me see how much roomier it was than I had imagined.

> [k1796] Some of the material I was asked to read estranged me with its
> showiness and its relentless knowingness and its pointlessness, as it
> seemed to me. Some I found humblingly incomprehensible despite my best
> efforts, and I was caught between admiration and contempt for people who
> spent a lifetime composing and disseminating artefacts of such
> over-wrought ugliness.

> [k1850] Maybe I should have been braver, should have sought her out
> afterwards. Our doubts are traitors. There was a clue I was missing, some
> way of being that would allow me to carry out audacious acts without
> hesitation.

> [k1961] I composed brief bewildering apothegms in the voice of al Biruni
> or Alhaj Ahmed ibn Khalas al Khalas al-Aduwi or whoever, and imagined my
> father reading them, sitting in a low-slung chair under a tree in Kuala
> Lumpur: In abeyance I faced the wood and saw a dazzling glimmer of the
> garden of the knowing, who willed the arbitration of the affairs of the
> beloved.

> [k1980] I denied myself whatever I could resist and saved what I earnt
> with stubborn determination. There was pleasure in the self-denial.

> [k1989] That is what happens to people like me in this country. If we are
> lucky we stop being foreigners and we become naturalised. Everything has
> changed so much, I feel I have been bleached or emptied of something
> vital but at last I have managed to complete my degree.

> [k2031] I duly became a local government officer.

> [k2036] It took over a year to make that journey and in that time I had
> become reconciled to many things but in particular to the salary that
> went silently into my bank account in return for my lackadaisical efforts
> in the office.

> [k2044] At times I thought I was waiting to return, at others that I
> never would.

> [k2049] We talked to each other as if we were on the same side, spoke the
> same language and had grown up with similar experiences and shared
> similar pleasures. Where I came from no one would dream of saying that
> anything to do with them was the best in the world. How could one know
> that without knowing the whole world?
>
> FIXME
> > [k2051] Here they have plenty which is the best in the world -- the
> best goalkeeper in the world, the best university in the world, the best
> hospital in the world, the best newspapers in the world. You had to take
> that in with your mother's milk to say such words without cringing.

> [k2053] When it was necessary to do so I said those words. I was becoming
> naturalised.

> [k2056] I had spent many years not knowing how to approach women,
> thinking of sexual intimacy as demeaning and an oppression, which enticed
> the victim into abjection, but then I found out it required nothing but
> willing partners.

> [k2088] Yes, I did have a telephone in the flat and I had her number
> beside it but I still had not been able to bring myself to make the call.
> It was another one of my anxieties but I did not know what I would say to
> her. I thought of the phone as an instrument to be used when there was
> something urgent to say and I had nothing like that to tell her. I had
> not spoken to her for years and I did not know where I would begin. And
> then he might answer the call. But that weekend evening, stung by guilt
> and Mr Mgeni's rebuke, I did call home. I dialled the number and after a
> few rings I was about to put the receiver down with relief when someone
> picked up. I heard a voice I could not mistake.

> [k2132] To myself I said: I will become one of England's helots like Mr
> Mgeni if I don't do something about myself, until one day England kills
> me too.
>
> FIXME
> > [k2133] After that call I lay in the darkness of the early hours,
> looking again at various plans I had considered in the past to extricate
> myself from my pointless life, then in the morning I dressed for work and
> fitted myself into the day's events.

> [k2418] I feel even more of a stranger here now. I hate it but still I
> stay. I feel like a traitor but I am not sure who it is that I am
> betraying.

> [k2542] am so happy to hear that your results
> FIXME

> [k2689] I gave an upbeat account of my life in England and to my surprise
> it lifted the burden of the years slightly. To my even greater surprise I
> found that I missed it. When I asked my father any questions he replied
> in his own way.

> [k3059] The British had no business interfering in this internecine
> mayhem -- they had not yet taken our little territory in hand for its own
> good -- but they did so anyway because they wanted the world to run as
> they liked it, even if it was only a caprice on their part. Exile this
> one, replace that one, hang the malcontents, even bombard the whole town
> ... why not? It was necessary in order to establish who was superior and
> had the power, and who should do precisely what he was told. Historians
> can always be found later to offer weighty policy explanations that
> prompted one petty meddling or another, to describe avarice and
> destruction in reasonable words.

> [k3344] I could tell that Amir was teasing me, provoking me, yet it was
> not a question he had asked me before, not straight out like that: why
> didn't you go with your family when they moved there? Because I did not
> want to live like a stranger, like a vagrant in someone else's country. I
> did not want to live among people whose language I did not speak and
> whose wealth would allow them to despise and patronise me. I wanted to
> stay here where I knew who I was and knew what was required of me.

> [k3903] 'The whole world ends up in London somehow,' I said. 'The British
> never left anyone in peace and squeezed everything good out of everybody
> and took it home, and now a bedraggled lot of niggers and turks have come
> to share in it.'

> [k3909] The only book I had read about Sierra Leone at that time was
> something by Graham Greene, and I did not remember any mention of Muslims
> in it apart from the corrupt Syrians whom all the English characters
> spoke about sneeringly.
>
> FIXME
> > [k3910] That was how people like you and I came to know of so much of
> the world, reading about it from people who despised us.

> [k4055] Some people have a use in the world, even if it is only to swell
> a crowd and say yeah, and some people don't.
