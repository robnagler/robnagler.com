By Malcolm X, Ballantine, January 15, 1992, 0345376714

Alex Haley spent two years meeting with Malcolm X to produce The
Autobiography of Malcolm X.

> [k153] When my mother was pregnant with me, she told me later, a party of
> hooded Ku Klux Klan riders galloped up to our home in Omaha, Nebraska,
> one night. Surrounding the house, brandishing their shotguns and rifles,
> they shouted for my father to come out.

> [k159] My father, the Reverend Earl Little, was a Baptist minister, a
> dedicated organizer for Marcus Aurelius Garvey's U.N.I.A. (Universal
> Negro Improvement Association).

> [k169] Among the reasons my father had decided to risk and dedicate his
> life to help disseminate this philosophy among his people was that he had
> seen four of his six brothers die by violence, three of them killed by
> white men, including one by lynching. What my father could not know then
> was that of the remaining three, including himself, only one, my Uncle
> Jim, would die in bed, of natural causes.

> [k178] Louise Little, my mother, who was born in Grenada, in the British
> West Indies, looked like a white woman. Her father was white.
>
> FIXME
> > [k179] Of this white father of hers, I know nothing except her shame
> about it.

> [k185] The teaching of Marcus Garvey stressed becoming independent of the
> white man.

> [k190] Soon, nearly everywhere my father went, Black Legionnaires were
> reviling him as an "uppity nigger" for wanting to own a store, for living
> outside the Lansing Negro district, for spreading unrest and dissention
> among "the good niggers."
>
> FIXME
> > [k192] Shortly after Yvonne was born came the nightmare night in 1929,
> my earliest vivid memory. I remember being suddenly snatched awake into a
> frightening confusion of pistol shots and shouting and smoke and flames.

> [k197] The white police and firemen came and stood around watching as the
> house burned down to the ground.

> [k203] After the fire, I remember that my father was called in and
> questioned about a permit for the pistol with which he had shot at the
> white men who set the fire.

> [k211] My father was also belligerent toward all of the children, except
> me. The older ones he would beat almost savagely if they broke any of his
> rules--and he had so many rules it was hard to know them all. Nearly all
> my whippings came from my mother.

> [k233] The only Negroes who really had any money were the ones in the
> numbers racket, or who ran the gambling houses, or who in some other way
> lived parasitically off the poorest ones, who were the masses. No Negroes
> were hired then by Lansing's big Oldsmobile plant, or the Reo plant.

> [k275] I learned early that crying out in protest could accomplish
> things.

> FIXME
> > [k277] I remember well how my mother asked me why I couldn't be a nice
> boy like Wilfred; but I would think to myself that Wilfred, for being so
> nice and quiet, often stayed hungry. So early in life, I had learned that
> if you want something, you had better make some noise.

> [k327] As the visitors tapered off, she became very concerned about
> collecting the two insurance policies that my father had always been
> proud he carried. He had always said that families should be protected in
> case of death. One policy apparently paid off without any problem--the
> smaller one.

> [k331] The company that had issued the bigger policy was balking at
> paying off. They were claiming that my father had committed suicide.
> Visitors came again, and there was bitter talk about white people: how
> could my father bash himself in the head, then get down across the
> streetcar tracks to be run over?

> [k343] She would go into Lansing and find different jobs--in housework,
> or sewing--for white people. They didn't realize, usually, that she was a
> Negro. A lot of white people around there didn't want Negroes in their
> houses.
>
> FIXME
> > [k345] She would do fine until in some way or other it got to people
> who she was, whose widow she was. And then she would be let go.

> [k372] But there were times when there wasn't even a nickel and we would
> be so hungry we were dizzy. My mother would boil a big pot of dandelion
> greens, and we would eat that.

> [k420] This was my first lesson about gambling: if you see somebody
> winning all the time, he isn't gambling, he's cheating. Later on in life,
> if I were continuously losing in any gambling situation, I would watch
> very closely. It's like the Negro in America seeing the white man win all
> the time. He's a professional gambler; he has all the cards and the odds
> stacked on his side, and he has always dealt to our people from the
> bottom of the deck.

> [k494] All I had done was to improve on their strategy, and it was the
> beginning of a very important lesson in life--that anytime you find
> someone more successful than you are, especially when you're both engaged
> in the same business--you know they're doing something that you aren't.

> [k500] Eventually my mother suffered a complete breakdown, and the court
> orders were finally signed. They took her to the State Mental Hospital at
> Kalamazoo.

> FIXME
> > [k502] We were "state children," court wards; he had the full say-so
> over us. A white man in charge of a black man's children! Nothing but
> legal, modern slavery--however kindly intentioned.

> [k516] I truly believe that if ever a state social agency destroyed a
> family, it destroyed ours. We wanted and tried to stay together. Our home
> didn't have to be destroyed. But the Welfare, the courts, and their
> doctor, gave us the one-two-three punch. And ours was not the only case
> of this kind.

> [k523] I have rarely talked to anyone about my mother, for I believe that
> I am capable of killing a person, without hesitation, who happened to
> make the wrong kind of remark about my mother.

> [k592] They all liked my attitude, and it was out of their liking for me
> that I soon became accepted by them--as a mascot, I know now. They would
> talk about anything and everything with me standing right there hearing
> them, the same way people would talk freely in front of a pet canary.
> They would even talk about me, or about "niggers," as though I wasn't
> there, as if I wouldn't understand what the word meant. A hundred times a
> day, they used the word "nigger." I suppose that in their own minds, they
> meant no harm; in fact they probably meant well.

> [k603] What I am trying to say is that it just never dawned upon them
> that I could understand, that I wasn't a pet, but a human being. They
> didn't give me credit for having the same sensitivity, intellect, and
> understanding that they would have been ready and willing to recognize in
> a white boy in my position. But it has historically been the case with
> white people, in their regard for black people, that even though we might
> be with them, we weren't considered of them. Even though they appeared to
> have opened the door, it was still closed. Thus they never did really see
> me. This is the sort of kindly condescension which I try to clarify
> today, to these integration-hungry Negroes, about their "liberal" white
> friends, these so-called "good white people"--most of them anyway.

> [k612] But I was no more than vaguely aware of anything like that in my
> detention-home years. I did my little chores around the house, and
> everything was fine.

> [k640] The one thing I didn't like about history class was that the
> teacher, Mr. Williams, was a great one for "nigger" jokes.

> [k643] Later, I remember, we came to the textbook section on Negro
> history. It was exactly one paragraph long. Mr. Williams laughed through
> it practically in a single breath, reading aloud how the Negroes had been
> slaves and then were freed, and how they were usually lazy and dumb and
> shiftless.

> [k649] Basketball was a big thing in my life, though. I was on the team;
> we traveled to neighboring towns such as Howell and Charlotte, and
> wherever I showed my face, the audiences in the gymnasiums "niggered" and
> "cooned" me to death. Or called me "Rastus."

> [k772] Mr. Ostrowski looked surprised, I remember, and leaned back in his
> chair and clasped his hands behind his head. He kind of half-smiled and
> said, "Malcolm, one of life's first needs is for us to be realistic.
> Don't misunderstand me, now. We all here like you, you know that. But
> you've got to be realistic about being a nigger. A lawyer--that's no
> realistic goal for a nigger. You need to think about something you can
> be. You're good with your hands--making things. Everybody admires your
> carpentry shop work. Why don't you plan on carpentry? People like you as
> a person--you'd get all kinds of work." The more I thought afterwards
> about what he said, the more uneasy it made me. It just kept treading
> around in my mind.

> [k781] They all reported that Mr. Ostrowski had encouraged what they had
> wanted. Yet nearly none of them had earned marks equal to mine. It was a
> surprising thing that I had never thought of it that way before, but I
> realized that whatever I wasn't, I was smarter than nearly all of those
> white kids. But apparently I was still not intelligent enough, in their
> eyes, to become whatever I wanted to be. It was then that I began to
> change--inside.

> [k800] I went every Saturday to see my brothers and sisters in Lansing,
> and almost every other day I wrote to Ella in Boston. Not saying why, I
> told Ella that I wanted to come there and live. I don't know how she did
> it, but she arranged for official custody of me to be transferred from
> Michigan to Massachusetts, and the very week I finished the eighth grade,
> I again boarded the Greyhound bus for Boston.
>
> FIXME
> > [k803] No physical move in my life has been more pivotal or profound in
> its repercussions.

> [k807] Whatever I have done since then, I have driven myself to become a
> success at it. I've often thought that if Mr. Ostrowski had encouraged me
> to become a lawyer, I would today probably be among some city's
> professional black bourgeoisie, sipping cocktails and palming myself off
> as a community spokesman for and leader of the suffering black masses,
> while my primary concern would be to grab a few more crumbs from the
> groaning board of the two-faced whites with whom they're begging to
> "integrate." All praise is due to Allah that I went to Boston when I did.
> If I hadn't, I'd probably still be a brainwashed black Christian.

> [k822] Ella still seemed to be as big, black, outspoken and impressive a
> woman as she had been in Mason and Lansing.

> [k1088] This was my first really big step toward self-degradation: when I
> endured all of that pain, literally burning my flesh to have it look like
> a white man's hair. I had joined that multitude of Negro men and women in
> America who are brainwashed into believing that the black people are
> "inferior"--and white people "superior"--that they will even violate and
> mutilate their God-created bodies to try to look "pretty" by white
> standards.

> [k1131] White customers on the shine stand, especially, would laugh to
> see my feet suddenly break loose on their own and cut a few steps. Whites
> are correct in thinking that black people are natural dancers. Even
> little kids are--except for those Negroes today who are so "integrated,"
> as I had been, that their instincts are inhibited. You know those
> "dancing jibagoo" toys that you wind up? Well, I was like a live
> one--music just wound me up.

> [k1171] People like the sleep-in maid for Beacon Hill white folks who
> used to come in with her "ooh, my deah" manners and order corn plasters
> in the Jew's drugstore for black folks.

> [k1426] Hundreds of Negro soldiers and sailors, gawking and young like
> me, passed by. Harlem by now was officially off limits to white
> servicemen. There had already been some muggings and robberies, and
> several white servicemen had been found murdered. The police were also
> trying to discourage white civilians from coming uptown, but those who
> wanted to still did.

> [k1440] It didn't take me a week to learn that all you had to do was give
> white people a show and they'd buy anything you offered them. It was like
> popping your shoeshine rag.

> [k1480] I never would forget that--that I couldn't have whipped that
> white man as badly with a club as I had with my mind.

> [k1599] Harlem's numbers industry hummed every morning and into the early
> afternoon, with the runners jotting down people's bets on slips of paper
> in apartment house hallways, bars, barbershops, stores, on the sidewalks.
> The cops looked on; no runner lasted long who didn't, out of his pocket,
> put in a free "figger" for his working area's foot cops, and it was
> generally known that the numbers bankers paid off at higher levels of the
> police department.

> [k1692] few days running in Small's, we would begin inquiring for him.

> [k1705] This shouldn't reflect too badly on that particular building,
> because almost everyone in Harlem needed some kind of hustle to survive,
> and needed to stay high in some way to forget what they had to do to
> survive.

> [k1713] I got my first schooling about the cesspool morals of the white
> man from the best possible source, from his own women.

> [k1723] Domineering, complaining, demanding wives who had just about
> psychologically castrated their husbands were responsible for the early
> rush. These wives were so disagreeable and had made their men so tense
> that they were robbed of the satisfaction of being men. To escape this
> tension and the chance of being ridiculed by his own wife, each of these
> men had gotten up early and come to a prostitute.

> [k1729] More wives could keep their husbands if they realized their
> greatest urge is to be men.

> [k1737] All women, by their nature, are fragile and weak: they are
> attracted to the male in whom they see strength.
>
> FIXME
> > [k1739] From time to time, Sophia would come over to see me from
> Boston. Even among Harlem Negroes, her looks gave me status.

> [k1787] The white woman wanted to be comfortable, she wanted to be looked
> upon with favor by her own kind, but also she wanted to have her
> pleasure. So some of them just married a white man for convenience and
> security, and kept right on going with a Negro.

> [k2455] He had never been able to keep a white woman any length of time,
> though, because he was too good to them, and, as I have said, any woman,
> white or black, seems to get bored with that.

> [k2498] Looking back, I think I really was at least slightly out of my
> mind. I viewed narcotics as most people regard food. I wore my guns as
> today I wear my neckties. Deep down, I actually believed that after
> living as fully as humanly possible, one should then die violently. I
> expected then, as I still expect today, to die at any time. But then, I
> think I deliberately invited death in many, sometimes insane, ways.

> [k2704] The girls got low bail. They were still white--burglars or not.
> Their worst crime was their involvement with Negroes. But Shorty and I
> had bail set at $10,000 each, which they knew we were nowhere near able
> to raise.

> [k2711] Before the judge entered, I said to one lawyer, "We seem to be
> getting sentenced because of those girls." He got red from the neck up
> and shuffled his papers: "You had no business with white girls!" Later,
> when I had learned the full truth about the white man, I reflected many
> times that the average burglary sentence for a first offender, as we all
> were, was about two years. But we weren't going to get the average--not
> for our crime.

> [k2717] But people are always speculating--why am I as I am? To
> understand that of any person, his whole life, from birth, must be
> reviewed. All of our experiences fuse into our personality. Everything
> that ever happened to us is an ingredient.

> [k2735] I got ten years. The girls got one to five years, in the Women's
> Reformatory at Framingham, Massachusetts.

> > [k2737] This was in February, 1946. I wasn't quite twenty-one. I had
> not even started shaving. They took Shorty and me, handcuffed together,
> to the Charlestown State Prison.

> [k2758] With some money sent by Ella, I was finally able to buy stuff for
> better highs from guards in the prison. I got reefers, Nembutal, and
> Benzedrine. Smuggling to prisoners was the guards' sideline; every
> prison's inmates know that's how guards make most of their living.

> [k2817] In prison, where so little breaks the monotonous routine, the
> smallest thing causes a commotion of talk. It was being mentioned all
> over the cell block by night that Satan didn't eat pork.

> [k2822] My brothers and sisters in Detroit and Chicago had all become
> converted to what they were being taught was the "natural religion for
> the black man" of which Philbert had written to me. They all prayed for
> me to become converted while I was in prison.

> [k2865] "The devil is also a man," Reginald said. "What do you mean?"

> [k2867] "Them," he said. "The white man is the devil."

> [k2871] said, "Without any exception?" "Without any exception."

> [k2874] The white people I had known marched before my mind's eye.

> [k2898] When Reginald left, he left me rocking with some of the first
> serious thoughts I had ever had in my life: that the white man was fast
> losing his power to oppress and exploit the dark world; that the dark
> world was starting to rise to rule the world again, as it had before;
> that the white man's world was on the way down, it was on the way out.

> [k2908] They were all Muslims, followers of a man they described to me as
> "The Honorable Elijah Muhammad," a small, gentle man, whom they sometimes
> referred to as "The Messenger of Allah." He was, they said, "a black man,
> like us." He had been born in America on a farm in Georgia. He had moved
> with his family to Detroit, and there had met a Mr. Wallace D. Fard who
> he claimed was "God in person."

> [k3020] I was to learn later that Elijah Muhammad's tales, like this one
> of "Yacub," infuriated the Muslims of the East. While at Mecca, I
> reminded them that it was their fault, since they themselves hadn't done
> enough to make real Islam known in the West. Their silence left a vacuum
> into which any religious faker could step and mislead our people.

> [k3034] The hardest test I ever faced in my life was praying.

> [k3038] I had to force myself to bend my knees. And waves of shame and
> embarrassment would force me back up. For evil to bend its knees,
> admitting its guilt, to implore the forgiveness of God, is the hardest
> thing in the world.

> [k3047] I've never been one for inaction. Everything I've ever felt
> strongly about, I've done something about.

> [k3097] Available on the prison library's shelves were books on just
> about every general subject. Much of the big private collection that
> Parkhurst had willed to the prison was still in crates and boxes in the
> back of the library--thousands of old books.

> [k3105] No university would ask any student to devour literature as I did
> when this new world opened to me, of being able to read and understand.

> [k3116] The teachings of Mr. Muhammad stressed how history had been
> "whitened"--when white men had written history books, the black man
> simply had been left out. Mr. Muhammad couldn't have said anything that
> would have struck me much harder. I had never forgotten how when my
> class, me and all of those whites, had studied seventh-grade United
> States history back in Mason, the history of the Negro had been covered
> in one paragraph, and the teacher had gotten a big laugh with his joke,
> "Negroes' feet are so big that when they walk, they leave a hole in the
> ground."

> [k3193] America's U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson complained not long ago
> that in the United Nations "a skin game" was being played. He was right.
> He was facing reality. A "skin game" is being played. But Ambassador
> Stevenson sounded like Jesse James accusing the marshal of carrying a
> gun. Because who in the world's history ever has played a worse "skin
> game" than the white man?

> [k3701] The black people, God's children, were Gods themselves, Master
> Fard taught. And he taught that among them was one, also a human being
> like the others, who was the God of Gods: The Most, Most High, The
> Supreme Being, supreme in wisdom and power--and His proper name was
> Allah.

> [k3839] (People don't want to believe the sums that even the minor
> underworld handles. Why, listen: in March 1964, a Chicago nickel-and-dime
> bets Wheel of Fortune man, Lawrence Wakefield, died, and over $760,000 in
> cash was in his apartment, in sacks and bags...all taken from poor
> Negroes...and we wonder why we stay so poor.)

> [k3890] And then we discovered the best "fishing" audience of all, by far
> the best-conditioned audience for Mr. Muhammad's teachings: the Christian
> churches.

> [k4155] Two white policemen, breaking up a street scuffle between some
> Negroes, ordered other Negro passers-by to "Move on!" Of these
> bystanders, two happened to be Muslim brother Johnson Hinton and another
> brother of Temple Seven. They didn't scatter and run the way the white
> cops wanted. Brother Hinton was attacked with nightsticks. His scalp was
> split open, and a police car came and he was taken to a nearby precinct.
> The second brother telephoned our restaurant. And with some telephone
> calls, in less than half an hour about fifty of Temple Seven's men of the
> Fruit of Islam were standing in ranks-formation outside the police
> precinct house.

> [k4169] Harlem's black people were long since sick and tired of police
> brutality
> FIXME

> [k4175] We wouldn't learn until later that a steel plate would have to be
> put into Brother Hinton's skull. (After that operation, the Nation of
> Islam helped him to sue; a jury awarded him over $70,000, the largest
> police brutality judgment that New York City has ever paid.)

> [k4222] In late 1959, the television program was aired. "The Hate That
> Hate Produced"--the title--was edited tightly into a kaleidoscope of
> "shocker" images...Mr. Muhammad, me, and others
> speaking...strong-looking, set-faced black men, our Fruit of
> Islam...white-scarved, white-gowned Muslim sisters of all ages...Muslims
> in our restaurants, and other businesses...Muslims and other black people
> entering and leaving our mosques.... Every phrase was edited to increase
> the shock mood.

> [k4231] Here was one of the white man's most characteristic behavior
> patterns--where black men are concerned. He loves himself so much that he
> is startled if he discovers that his victims don't share his vainglorious
> self-opinion.

> [k4271] "The guilty, two-faced white man can't decide what he wants. Our
> slave foreparents would have been put to death for advocating so-called
> 'integration' with the white man. Now when Mr. Muhammad speaks of
> 'separation,' the white man calls us 'hate-teachers' and 'fascists'!

> [k4280] "Mr. Malcolm X," those devils would ask, "why is your Fruit of
> Islam being trained in judo and karate?"

> [k4308] The reporters would try their utmost to raise some "good" white
> man whom I couldn't refute as such. I'll never forget how one practically
> lost his voice. He asked me did I feel any white men had ever done
> anything for the black man in America. I told him, "Yes, I can think of
> two. Hitler, and Stalin. The black man in America couldn't get a decent
> factory job until Hitler put so much pressure on the white man. And then
> Stalin kept up the pressure--

> [k4317] But instead of abating, the black puppets continued ripping and
> tearing at Mr. Muhammad and the Nation of Islam--until it began to appear
> as though we were afraid to speak out against these "important" Negroes.
> That's when Mr. Muhammad's patience wore thin. And with his nod, I began
> returning their fire.

> [k4901] The American black man should be focusing his every effort toward
> building his own businesses, and decent homes for himself. As other
> ethnic groups have done, let the black people, wherever possible, however
> possible, patronize their own kind, hire their own kind, and start in
> those ways to build up the black race's ability to do for itself. That's
> the only way the American black man is ever going to get respect.

> [k5001] These "angry revolutionists" even followed their final
> instructions: to leave early. With all of those thousands upon thousands
> of "angry revolutionists," so few stayed over that the next morning the
> Washington hotel association reported a costly loss in empty rooms.
> Hollywood couldn't have topped it. In a subsequent press poll, not one
> Congressman or Senator with a previous record of opposition to civil
> rights said he had changed his views. What did anyone expect? How was a
> one-day "integrated" picnic going to counter-influence these
> representatives of prejudice rooted deep in the psyche of the American
> white man for four hundred years?

> [k5025] I never experienced one college session that didn't show me ways
> to improve upon my presentation and defense of Mr. Muhammad's teachings.

> [k5028] At the outset, always I'd confront such panels with something
> such as: "Gentlemen, I finished the eighth grade in Mason, Michigan. My
> high school was the black ghetto of Roxbury, Massachusetts. My college
> was in the streets of Harlem, and my master's was taken in prison. Mr.
> Muhammad has taught me that I never need fear any man's intellect who
> tries to defend or to justify the white man's criminal record against the
> non-white man--especially the white man and the black man here in North
> America."

> [k5038] Question-and-answer periods are another area where, by now, again
> blindfolded, I can often tell you the ethnic source of a question. The
> most easily recognizable of these to me are a Jew in any audience
> situation, and a bourgeois Negro in "integrated" audiences. My clue to
> the Jew's question and challenges is that among all other ethnic groups,
> his expressed thinking, his expressed concerns, are the most subjective.
> And the Jew is usually hypersensitive. I mean, you can't even say "Jew"
> without him accusing you of anti-Semitism. I don't care what a Jew is
> professionally, doctor, merchant, housewife, student, or whatever--first
> he, or she, thinks Jew.

> [k5045] But I know that America's five and a half million Jews (two
> million of them are concentrated in New York) look at it very
> practically, whether they know it or not: that all of the bigotry and
> hatred focused upon the black man keeps off the Jew a lot of heat that
> would be on him otherwise. For an example of what I am talking about--in
> every black ghetto, Jews own the major businesses. Every night the owners
> of those businesses go home with that black community's money, which
> helps the ghetto to stay poor. But I doubt that I have ever uttered this
> absolute truth before an audience without being hotly challenged, and
> accused by a Jew of anti-Semitism. Why? I will bet that I have told five
> hundred such challengers that Jews as a group would never watch some
> other minority systematically siphoning out their community's resources
> without doing something about it. I have told them that if I tell the
> simple truth, it doesn't mean that I am anti-Semitic; it means merely
> that I am antiexploitation.

> [k5927] That morning was when I first began to reappraise the "white
> man." It was when I first began to perceive that "white man," as commonly
> used, means complexion only secondarily; primarily it described attitudes
> and actions. In America, "white man" meant specific attitudes and actions
> toward the black man, and toward all other non-white men. But in the
> Muslim world, I had seen that men with white complexions were more
> genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been.

> [k6047] Despite my firm convictions, I have been always a man who tries
> to face facts, and to accept the reality of life as new experience and
> new knowledge unfolds it. I have always kept an open mind, which is
> necessary to the flexibility that must go hand in hand with every form of
> intelligent search for truth.

> [k6281] I remember that in the press conference, I used the word "Negro,"
