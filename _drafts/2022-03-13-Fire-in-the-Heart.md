Enjoyed. Made me rethink how I can help. It drove me to help.

I don't like how so many of the activits are lawyers. That's a select
group so hard to apply generally. Also they are all some kind of
leader, good at leading.

I didn't like the lack of efficacy. How good are these people at being
activists?

How are we changing society in the large is not really discussed. It's
touched on in the summary, but it isn't clear that there's any data to
show that any of this does any good other than time heals.

> [k96] Yet when I asked white students at Fordham College, where I used to

> [k214] In my view, white passivity is the primary obstacle to further
> progress in achieving racial justice.

> [k239] Was slavery a system of racism or of economic exploitation? The
> choice is a false one. Racism remains centrally implicated in economic
> and other forms of inequality faced by African Americans today.

> [k251] Furthermore, after some initial gains in the sixties and
> seventies, our schools are, in fact, more segregated today than in the

> largely inductive study.

> [k380] Each interview lasted about three hours.

> [k394] Because I wanted to explore these issues in depth, I decided to
> interview fifty activists. I thought this number was large enough to
> capture a variety of activists but small enough to enable me to explore
> each person's views in detail.

> [k402] First, I decided to focus on activists whose work with regard to
> racism primarily involves African Americans and secondarily Latinos. I
> prioritized racism toward African Americans for several reasons.
> Antiblack racism represents perhaps the central dynamic in U.S. history
> and the sharpest racial dividing line. Even today, African Americans
> remain the most segregated group, and there is evidence that whites
> particularly resist integration with African Americans, whether in
> housing or in interracial relationships.

> [k478] In this book I use the activists' real names. I believe this
> practice increases the realism and authenticity of the work.

> [k536] In a similar vein, William Julius Wilson argues that white support
> for affirmative action is necessary if whites want blacks to join the
> broad coalition whites need to confront the economic power of the elites.
> With interest conversion and these other coalitional variants, however,
> the problem remains that whites are not authentically in support of
> racial justice.
>
> FIXME
> > [k540] In the negotiations of interests that drive the coalitional
> model, there is not much room for a deeper connection across the racial
> divide that could lead whites to embrace racial justice as their own
> cause.

> [k541] The second account, the altruistic model, also accepts that
> whites' interests are normally in competition with those of people of
> color.

> [k545] Moreover, people of color regard altruistic white people--the
> do-gooders and helpers--with suspicion for their paternalism. The ally

> chained to their beds and gassed and led around on a leash just like Abu
> Ghraib. That stuff is absolutely horrible.

> [k793] In 1990 David drove to the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola
> to represent prisoners with mental illnesses. He tells this story of his
> first visit:

> [k799] You routinely see white guards on horseback with shotguns in
> front. In back in rows two by two, shoulder to shoulder, forty or fifty
> inmates, all black, all in standard prison uniforms carrying hoes and
> manual tools. They walk five miles out into the fields and manually work
> the farm in the morning, walk back with these white guards on horseback,
> get fed, walk back. That was their day--literally. These mother f-ckers
> built a golf course on this plantation, on this prison, and they refused
> to use any machinery.
>
> FIXME
> > [k804] Of the 5,000 inmates I bet you 4,500 are black. Generations of
> prison guards have worked and lived on the prison, almost all white.
> There was not a whit of difference between a prison guard and the
> prisoner in terms of education and morals.

> [k820] Myrdal's study has been controversial from the beginning. Some
> critics point out that slavery and racism were not aberrations of
> American ideology but were fundamental to the system at its origins and
> that slavery was in fact enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.

> [k833] The witnessing of racism through a direct experience appears
> important.

> [k837] Seminal experiences represent abrupt events, a crystallization of
> awareness in time.

> [k840] I remember when we'd drive in a car, and we'd go through a black
> neighborhood, we'd be told, lock the doors and roll up the windows.

> [k851] For a seminal experience to have an effect, the affected person
> has to make a real shift to begin to challenge the dominant ideology.

> [k859] I have been tracing the development of commitment over time in the
> lives of activists. I have not seen a one-time conversion; rather, I
> often see the process of commitment growing over time.

> [k897] After a few years of living in the Seventh Ward, just a few blocks
> away from the school, I started to get a much better sense of the culture
> and community that I was teaching in. I was tired of hearing what the
> kids couldn't do instead of what they could do.

> [k908] The normal workings of the system continually pushed them toward a
> white world despite the influence of their families. Living in the
> dominant world, they ended up having seminal experiences that shocked
> them back toward a recognition of racism.

> [k931] When they were young, they grew up in the multiracial friendship
> network that Laurie and her husband were part of. For personal reasons,
> though, the boys were sent to a private high school that was largely
> white. When they then went on to attend private colleges in New England,
> Laurie realized that their world was gradually becoming whiter and
> whiter.

> [k936] He is struggling to gain his own understanding of racial issues as
> an adult and gain his own comfort level in dealing with people of color.
> He's really struggled and is struggling. His values are there, which I
> think is a result of his upbringing. But he does not have the comfort,
> the set of skills, and the sense of self to really actualize it yet. I
> know that that's a result of the choices we made and the world we raised

> [k962] Margo argued that a dominant culture shouldn't exist in the first
> place, and that "shook things up" quite a bit for Susan.

> [k968] Later she came to direct Justice Matters, an advocacy group whose
> mission is to bring about racially just schools by developing and
> promoting educational policy rooted in community vision.

NOTE: Many of these people are leaders.this puts them in a category of their own.

> [k970] While many activists in the study talked, like Susan, about the

> the cognitive aspect played in the development of their commitment.

> [k975] Guilford's really good at critical thinking and learning how to
> criticize all these things, but it's so overwhelming, and it's so
> depressing.

> [k978] Being in the Beloved Community Center, I was treated like it
> mattered that I was here.

> [k981] If anything,

> [k984] The prostitutes I represented were almost all black and Latino.

> [k982] Speaking of the impact of his earlier work representing clients in
> criminal cases, Mark Soler underscores that, for him, understanding
> racism is not simply an intellectual project: The prostitutes I
> represented were almost all black and Latino. For the most part they were
> prostitutes because they had no other options.

NOTE: Thdy are also a lot of lawyers

> [k989] Learning in detail about the history of slavery or the workings of
> contemporary racism, however important for many reasons, does not appear
> to motivate white people to act.

> [k1024] saw communities living right next to glass-crushing factories or
> concrete-crushing factories. The air was filled with glass dust and
> concrete dust, and kids were coughing up blood. I couldn't believe that I
> had never been to this part of LA, and here it was, twenty minutes away.

> [k1043] Like Roxane, many people in this study cited college as a turning
> point.

> [k1162] A few, however, came to activism somewhat later in life, two in
> their late thirties and one in her forties. Molly Munger was a successful
> forty-two-year-old corporate lawyer in Los Angeles when the Rodney King
> beating occurred in 1991.

> [k1185] Molly left her corporate job to work for the NAACP Legal Defense
> Fund (LDF) against Proposition 209, the antiaffirmative action
> initiative.

> [k1196] People appear to be led toward racial justice activism when they
> see a contradiction between their community's deeply held values and the
> reality of racism.

> [k1200] Indeed, not a single person in the study offered an
> interest-based account of the start of their journey toward racial
> justice.

> [k1239] Penda and her family attended a Southern Baptist church. Penda
> took the values her faith tradition preached seriously and joined a youth
> choir that sought to recruit new kids to their Sunday school. It turned
> out, though, that the congregation had an official whites-only policy:

> [k1247] So the church voted again, and they voted to exclude African
> Americans again. And that had a huge impact on me. I would say that was
> probably defining. I'm starting to cry now thinking about it because we
> had to go tell those kids that we couldn't come and take them to church
> anymore.

> [k1255] Penda went on to Harvard Law School and was influenced by its
> progressive political climate.

> [k1296] And then it was personal in the sense that Lani was staying at my
> house part of the time when she would come down to do her DC round of
> meetings. I remember I had just had a baby. At the time, when the
> newspapers were writing all these things about how antiwhite she was, I
> remember her sitting in my house in the rocking chair, holding my white,
> blond-headed baby. And it was just surreal. How can this happen? How can
> they paint a picture of her that is so beyond reality, and yet they get
> away with it? The humiliation of Lani Guinier affected Penda deeply.
> Subsequent battles with the Clinton administration over both the welfare
> reform bill and affirmative action led Penda and a set of LDF colleagues
> to feel the limitations of legal strategies in isolation from organized
> power in communities: We were very angry with the Clinton administration.

> [k1317] Relationships with people of color are a key link in the
> development of an understanding of racism and a commitment that makes the
> political issue of racial justice personal.

> [k1486] While a student at Harvard, Madeline got involved in a welfare
> rights organization and built relationships with an activist group of
> African American welfare mothers.

> [k1522] Christine turned down a prestigious offer to become dean of

> [k1678] Commitment grows through those relationships as whites come to

NOTE: Why is this true

> [k4114] John Brown worked not simply for black men--he worked with them;
> and he was a companion of their daily life, knew their faults and
> virtues, and felt, as few white Americans have felt, the bitter tragedy
> of their lot. --W.E.B.

> [k4140] Americans place great faith in education as a force for social
> change.

> [k4190] The many children of color who drop out of high school are no
> longer just numbers but rather real people to whom they are connected.
> Eventually activists make the cause their own through the construction of
> a moral vision of a just, multiracial, and human community.

NOTE: But whre is efficacy .why is rhere no reduction in the terrible situation
