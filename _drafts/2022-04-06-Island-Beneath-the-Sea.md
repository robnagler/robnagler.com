> [k2227] Immediately, from out of nowhere, sprang an orderly followed by
> three slaves, four people for two little cups: one of the slaves held the
> tray, another poured the coffee, and the third offered sugar.

> [k2249] "The situation in Saint-Domingue is different from that in other
> colonies. Here the slaves have never accepted their fate, they have risen
> up again and again for almost a century; there are tens of thousands of
> Maroons in the mountains. And at the present we have half a million
> slaves. They know that the republic abolished slavery in France, and they
> are ready to fight to obtain the same here. The mar<FIXME e9>chauss<FIXME
> e9>e will not be able to control them."

> [k3253] ONE MONTH LATER, on the smoking remains of Le Cap, which was
> reduced to rubble and ash, Sonthonax proclaimed the emancipation of the
> slaves on Saint-Domingue. Without them the French would not have been
> able to wage a war against their internal enemies and against the
> English, who now occupied the south. That same day Toussaint also
> declared emancipation from his encampment in Spanish territory. He signed
> the document as Toussaint Louverture, the name with which he would enter
> history.

> [k3458] His manners were impeccable, an essential requirement in the
> upper class, where the proper use of the fork was more important than
> moral tenets.

> [k3510] The life of a Creole monsieur was spent at leisure; work was a
> vice of Protestants in general and Americans in particular.

> [k3736] The island was a fly on the map, they said, it could never
> confront the power of the French army. With victory, the <FIXME
> e9>migr<FIXME e9>s could return, and everything would be as it was
> before; there would be no mercy for the blacks, they would kill them all
> and bring fresh meat from Africa.

> [k5079] As the days raced by the idea prevailed that it wasn't true, but
> they kept talking about the accursed Corsican, because remember,
> monsieurs, that Napoleon is from Corsica; it can't be said that he's
> French, he has sold us to the Kaintucks.

> [k5094] The entire city was in agreement that to belong to the United
> States was the equivalent of the end of family, culture, and the one true
> religion. Valmorain and Sancho, who dealt with Americans in their
> businesses, brought a conciliatory note to all that ruction, explaining
> that the Kaintucks were frontiersmen, more or less like buccaneers, and
> not all Americans could be judged by them.

> [k5110] That same month, Dessalines proclaimed the independence of
> Saint-Domingue under the name of the R<FIXME e9>publique N<FIXME e8>gre
> d'Ha<FIXME ef>ti, with a new blue and red flag.
