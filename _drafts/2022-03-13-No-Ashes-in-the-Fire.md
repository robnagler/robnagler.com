WITH: > [k164] South Camden smelled like a steamy concoction of about half a million residents' shit and weeks-old rotten food shipped from the suburbs to the county trash incinerator in my neighborhood. If Camden smelled, it wasn't the fault of city residents. The trash incinerator was built in Camden because it was a predominantly black and Latino city. It not only polluted the air with a nauseous smell but also contributed to asthma and other illnesses. It's simply what we had to endure.

By Darnell L Moore, Some Publisher, Month 1, 201x, ISBN

Powerful book. Really gives insight into a Gay African American mind and
life. Very happy he was so vulnerable to write this. The
intersectionality is critical to understanding Moore. Gives me much
more appreciation for the plight of LGBTQ minorities.

I was disturbed by the view of white people. They are not helping but
they help, and I think he was helped. He thinks Whites are just as
ahppy to not see the problems. We are just as powerless as anybody is to
change the world.

> [k55] I once knew this black boy in the photos, but at some point between

> [k57] Thirty years later, I looked at the photos with keen interest in my

> [k69] This book is a search for self. While looking over my mama's

> [k91] Stereotyping black urban cities like Camden as "ghetto" and the
> people who live within them as leeches sucking the state dry of its

> [k121] Those black LGBTQ people were killed because they were courageous
> enough to reveal the unseen hands that ball up in the form of a fist when
> confronted with difference. Sometimes the hand is black.

> [k128] This story is not new. And my story is not unique. Black queer,
